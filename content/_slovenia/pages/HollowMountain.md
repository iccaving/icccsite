Our exploration from the beginning up until 2006 has been painstakingly collated and edited into a surprisingly readable book. It is available in physical form (at a small cost) and digitally (for free).

[Buy it from LULU.com](http://www.lulu.com/content/909368) for less than a tenner (including P&amp;P to EU). 246 A4 pages of international caving exploration!
