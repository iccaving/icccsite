## The Expedition - An Introduction

Imperial College Caving Club has run joint expeditions with the <a href="http://www.pdtolmin.si">JSPDT</a> to the Julian alps in Western Slovenia most summers since 1994. The destination is Tolminski Migovec, a large undulating limestone plateau located about 6km North of the town of Tolmin within the Triglav national park.
Located midway between <i>Tolminski Kuk</i> and <i>Vogel</i> at approximately N 46 15' E 013 45' (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=46.25+13.75&amp;ll=46.249971,13.74999&amp;spn=0.028252,0.086517&amp;t=k&amp;om=1">Google Maps Satellite Data</a>), the large area offers enormous scope for further cave development.

Expedition base camp is located at 1880m above sea level on the western edge of the plateau, with the <a href="/rcc/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/2012/2012-08-01-2225-AndyJurd-P8013205.jpg">bivi</a> situated in a large shakehole benefiting from the shelter of a [distinctly unstable looking] rock bridge.

## Reports, Surveys and Data

Every year we take hundreds of photos, survey our new findings, produce a extensive written report and full drawn surveys of the entire cave system. You'll find those all on this site. Each year has a page dedicated to it, check the menu, and the page for 2017 is [here](/rcc/caving/slovenia/articles/2017-07-07-slovenia.html) with the information on the latest expedition.

All of our cave data, updated and worked on throughout the year, is freely accessible in our [Github repo.](https://github.com/jarvist/migovecsurveydata). 

We have also produced a book full of entertaining stories, anecdotes, maps, surveys and cartoons from the expedition from it's beginning up to 2006. This is [The Hollow Mountain](/rcc/caving/slovenia/pages/hollowmountain.html) and is available for free as a PDF or for printing on demand via [lulu.com](http://www.lulu.com/content/909368). Work on The Hollow Mountain II (2006-2012) and The Hollow Mountain III (2012-2017) is well underway!
