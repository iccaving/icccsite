## Summary
A summary of the 2018 expedition, where 2.6km of new cave were explored.

The Klic Globin expedition took place between Friday 6th July and Sunday 12th August 2018. In total a group of ICCC and NUCC cavers, 30 strong came out for five weeks on the Migovec Plateau to continue the exploration of Primadona, within the Tolminski Migovec Cave system. The main achievments of the expeditions are the setting up of an underground camp at the bottom of TTT pitch, connected to the surface with a functional Cave-Link text messaging system. This was a springboard from which deep exploration below Pivnica (old Slovene deep route) took place, culminating with the finding of a significant, and now deeper, branch containing pitches large and small, and the promise of both further depth (200m to go to the presumed water table) and perhaps significant horizontal passage. The Alabaster branch was also further extended south, gaining nearly 800m of new passage, and breaking the -600m below M2 mark. Surface action successes include the exciting breakthrough in Coincidence Cave, gaining 40m of new cave, and confirming its outstanding potential through consistently strong draught.

## Exploration
### Surface leads
##### Coincidence Cave
See Jack's report on UKC. 

The draughting tube was dug out by a team of dedicated ICCC physicists over the course of two days before a major breakthrough led to the discovery of a deep, but narrow pitch, Hell's Teeth. All in all, about 93m of passage were surveyed in Coincidence Cave. Chemical persuasion is required to progress into the strongly draughting rift (cave blows out during Summer and Autumn) at the 'working end' of the cave. 
##### M17 
See Tanguy's report on UKC.

M17 was revisited by Rhys, Arun, Diss and Dave Kp early in the expedition to take photographs of the ice rink chamber (-50m), but the seasonal ice fillings proved disappointing, as they were already mostly melted away. Tanguy, Andy and Jana then revisited the cave to install some temperature/humidity loggers at the base of the ice shaft and further at the back of the main chamber next to ice mass. Readings were taken in mid-October, and the lower ice shaft (-80m) were accessed then, with dwarf pine samples taken from the layered ice still to be dated. 

##### M19
M19 was revisited by Tanguy, Louise and Celia during the summer expedition, with the aim of assessing the potential of this cave as an 'ice archive'. Three short pitches inside the cave were dropped, whereupon it was found that the cave was ice free, barring the entrance snow slope. The faintly draughting passage led to the head of a fourth (10m) pitch, undropped in 2018 - but surveyed back in 1994, with evidence from the rusty spits. The state of the pushing front is unclear, described as 'needing shoring' to allow further progress (Hollow Mountain 2007).

##### Venus Fly Trap 
Revisited by Jack, Tom and Celia(?) during the summer expedition, dedicated digging allowed progress to a further, as yet unsurveyed small chamber, with little prospect of further extension.

### High level leads

##### The Cloaca Maxima extensions
Back in 2016, Clare and Tanguy surveyed nearly 250m of shallowly dipping abandoned phreatic tube taking a freezing draught between the high level Monatip rift and the top of a large void, purported on site to be Alkatraz (later confirmed by the 3d plot on Aven). 

Chris, Stane, Zdenko and Tanguy traversed from Monatip to Primadona using the Cloaca Maxima route, dropping the pitch (circa P50) into Alkatraz chamber. On the way, a branching in the high levels of Cloaca Maxima led to about 100m of new draughty crawlway (explored upwind), heading roughly to the NE, under the main Monatip connection passages. This is an open lead near the surface, heading for the surface.

Later, David P Wilson and Arun dropped one of the pitches in Cloaca Maxima, (Well Hung, P17, P30), reconnecting with the lower Monatip rift soon after and providing yet another loop in this already complex region of the cave. Soon after, Ben R. and Tanguy revisited Cloaca Maxima to tick off the remaining leads. In so doing they climbed circa 8m into a continuing aven not far from the Alkatraz pitch. This lead remains open. 

The Cloaca Maxima route was also estimated to enter Alkatraz chamber roughly half-way down. Any entrance on the side of the cliff located south of Primadona is bound to lead straight into Alkatraz. Go looking under the rock-bridge!

##### Galerija and below
Several trips to this area by David P. Wilson yielded a better understanding of the entire Galerija/Karstaway/Electric Dreams relationship.

1. **Unsurveyed ramblings** Just after the traverse over the Quantum State pitch, a high level way on, indicated by carbide arrow, leads to an inclined rift of large dimensions. A traverse on the true right hand side of the rift leads to a narrower passage with black mud ponds (unsurveyed as of 08/2018, but with clear footprints). Soon, a wet window on the left hand side looks onto a pitch of respectable dimensions, but the narrow passage continues until the true floor disappears, replaced by a boulder blockage false-floor through which it is possible to see a continuation. This is the supposed but unsurveyed link between Galerija and the Stara Jama branch, which remains one of the surveying objectives of future expeditions, and would provide an alternative route from Sejna Soba to Mandare junction.

2. **Odessy** Beyond the Electric Dreams traverse over Karstaway pitch, a short section of rift leads to a modest (rigged) drop. On the far side lies the 'Sword of Damocles', a wedged boulder under which the main on was originally pushed in 2017. In 2018, Dave, Louise and Chris traversed over the top of the pitch, to find 'Oddesy', a narrow passage that eventually opened up to a large pitch, now presumed to be the large Electric Dreams pitch, accessed from a higher level, which might provide an easier route to some of the high level windows already spotted on the pitch; none were pushed in 2018. All in all, 44m were surveyed in Odessy.

3. **Dysentry** Arguably already at a much lower level, Dysentry was found by Dave and Tanguy early during the summer expedition. The passage starts as a small side crawl located within the More Like Welding rift (at the junction between the Mighty Fine Indeed - Electric Dreams branches). After a few twists, the crawl degenerates to a squeeze, followed by a (then) cleanwashed abandoned phreatic conduit. A short series of downclimbs into a rift is followed by more crawling, to gain a three-way junction with a good draught. Upwind drops to a sediment filled chamber, while downwind relents with some standing height passage and further branching passages leading off. The obvious abandone phreatic pops into an E-W oriented breakdown chamber, with to the west, about 50m of fairly easy walking/scrambling, unfortunately choked by boulders. To the east, a high route leads to 15m unclimbed aven, while a drop through boulders leads to a continuing rift. A couple of other leads were left unpushed, such as a 6m pitch just beyond the first nasty squeeze, which takes a very small stream. This likely reconnects with the Hall of the Mountain King, which lies just 30m away in the passage direction. All in all, 180m were surveyed in Dysentry.

### Hallelujah Branch

##### Mud Moses

##### Holy Moley/Purgatory
At the base of the Sweet Baby Jesus pitch, a branching which had been left unpushed in 2017 was explored, leading to a small sediment filled low passage (the advised route avoids the deep white sand banks). About 10m on from the branching, a 5m pitch leads to a small chamber with a low way on. This Holy Moley is approximately 40m of passage, punctuated by avoidable deep pools of water, which leads to a 15m pitch (Adequately Hammered) immediately connected with the Alabaster Aven. This route to Alabaster has become the de facto trade route. 

The Purgatory is the pitch and chamber immediately below the 2017 pushing front of Alabaster. In essence, the remaining 5m of the Alabaster pitch were dropped, and a chamber with two main ways on found just beyond. The obvious continuation (in the same direction as Alabaster passage) is unpushed, while a short 5m pitch on the true right hand side leads on to Bath.

##### Bath/Canticle for Migovec/Testify!
Bath continues from the end of Purgatory as a sucession of small pitches (P5, P4, P4) leading to a larger drop (P15,P5,P5,P8). The rock remains surprisingly white, free of loose rocks and mud. The bottom of each pitch is a small pool of water with white sand on the nearby ledges often rippled/showing high water stands did occur (how far in the past?) in this part of the cave. The last pitch in Bath has a larger pool, and on the far side, a climb into virgin territory (unpushed in 2018). A low abandoned vadone canyon leads to the head of the next pitch.

The P20 is the start of Canticle for Migovec, at the base of which a short 5m drop leads into a short section of awkward low passage until the next pitch (P30), rigged of several deviations. The base of the pitch leads to approximately 100m of tall winding and deeply scalloped canyon. Another circa 30m pitch leads to the next section: Testify!.

At the base of the pitch, two ways on beckon, the 'walking way' and the 'crawling way'. Soon they rejoin at a short downclimb, where another inlet to the main passage can also be followed for several metres, but the main way on is downstream the abandoned, sinuous vadose canyon which continues for another 150m to the head of last, undescended pitch (ca. P30). This is a phenomenal lead.
