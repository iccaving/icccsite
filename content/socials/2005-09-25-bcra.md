Title: BCRA Conference
Date: 2005-09-25
Location: mendips
Summary: With the help of the National Express & B.Ogbourne's Tardis golf, six of us made it down to the national caving conference being held in a school Churchill, Somerset. Rik gave a light-hearted talk about our discoveries in Slovenia this summer; many other presentations & videos were viewed, and some truly awful dancing enjoyed.

Flinging ourselves out of London via the magic of the National Express, we
were picked up from a dingy Bristol street by our local yokel, Ben. Zooming
along to Churchill packed in the rather close confines of Ben's peeling Golf,
Clewin posed the rhetorical 'Is that Jan?' question. Matched by a chorus of
'Where's Jan?', the question was rather more pertinent than usual, as we
overtook his bike by a particularly dodgy looking estate, shouting a few
exuberious salutations out the wound-down window.

Jarvist Frost

There's always something that really grabs me at these conferences. This year,
somewhat worryingly like last year, it was cave diving - for the shear
determination in the face of sanity, digging gravel, in a constricted passage,
60m underwater and filming it at the same time!

On arriving at the campsite on Friday night I found the least well pitched of
the three Vango Equinox's (alias 'the casino'), parked my bike, brushed the
curry from my clothes and located Rik, Jarv, Deep, Clewin and Ben in the bar.

The next day, escaping the fog of noxious gases in the tent and stumbling
outside, I releived myself by the hedge, to the dismay of passers-by; then
after some festering in the morning sun, a quick run down to the shops on the
bike provided Ben with the ingredients to create breakfast and hot brown
(possibly tea) on his stove; and we were heading over to the conference centre
sooner than a Jarvist Frost Alpine start to get our delegate badges.

As always choosing between lectures can sometimes be hard, there was a talk on
British Columbia by some random Canadian (in fact one of the infamous
Dangerous Dick And The Duckbusters) and one on the Nullarbor by cave dive
legend Martyn Farr (legendary partly for his entertaining talks) - as British
Columbia seemed a more likely travel destination for me, than a vast arid
desert in Southern Australia, I chose that and was treated to some peculiar
Canadian humour involving plungers and potatoes. Rik's afternoon talk on IC3's
expedition was excellent and well attended, and afterwards I set off on my
bike to attempt a descent of Cheddar Gorge in record time, in my absence
Clewin attempted to eat the local pub carvery clean and subsequently was
unable to move. So in the evening, the remaining IC3 cavers went along to see
the Cheddar Blues Band and pull our best worst dance moves on the floor, while
Clewin suffered in the tent. Beer was drunk and with the sound of drum solos
ringing in our ears we eventually stumbled back to the casino. Sunday mornings
routine followed a similiar theme as before. While back at the conference Rick
Stanton gave a more in-depth talk on his diving in Wookey Hole, and some
further heart stopping dive footage. The day was a much more subdued affair,
tea was consumed and a long lunch taken, the others disappeared back to
Bristol soon after Cambridge uni's Austrian expedition talk. I needed to cycle
to Weston-super-Mare for a train, but hung around for the closing ceremony
with one eye on the time. With the traditional technical palava it got
underway about an hour late, but unfortunately I had to sneek out early to get
home.
