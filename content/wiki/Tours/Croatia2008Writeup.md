Plans
-----

Easter: the classic ICCC time for fun in the sun, easy caving and
Mediterranean villa action. But no - that would not be enough for this
year, the yearn for the blank space on the map and the land beyond being
too much of a pull. Jana attracted our attention to Croatia - far more
savaged in the Yugoslav wars than our home-from-home in Slovenia, the
country had a limestone backbone as thick and unpenetratable as the
Byzantine bureacracy that protected it from external probing.

However, with a bit of judicious emailing, and Croatian language skills
from Jana we found some extremely hospitable hosts who worked the
official machinery and constructed a most wonderful week of caving for
us.

Having exhausted most of the possible locations in the Mediterranean, it
was hard to think of an exotic place to cave, which was near enough for
us to go on Easter tour to. Back in December I started thinking about
Croatia: We used to live in one country (Jugoslavija – Yugoslavia) and
now it is the next door neighbour to Slovenia, yet I had never been
caving there. Organisation was difficult - with our hosts being a
thousand miles away, the situation complex to explain and the fact that
no English cavers had been there in over twenty years.

Snow

The night before it had seemed like a brilliant idea. Sleep in stores,
thereby avoiding the danger of people missing the 6am wakeout, and
thereby punish the group by failing to bring a necessary bit of
equipment. Waking up in the drafty and really rather cold concrete
corridor was not so pleasent. The night before had seen a whole evening
of packing, trying to compress the bulky caving kit into the fascist
Ryanair baggage allowances. In order to go straight to the cave, we had
to pack enough food and equipment for everyone to wild camp and cave for
three days.

Stumble out by the Albert hall and drift to Victoria, sagging and
swaying under our obscene loads, bulky as snow men with our layers of
fleece. As we wait for the Easybus the first flakes begin to fall,
setting the scene for the first few days in Croatia.

Baggage check in was the usual excitement - having to take our enormous
bags to oversize luggage being rather useful. Disaster then struck - Dan
was sweetly told by the checkout lady that his passport had expired. One
more month and all would have been fine, as it was we simply split his
communual kit amongst ourselves and send him back to London with a
rather sad face.

The drive from Trieste to Sveti Rok was long and either boring or too
exciting (e.g. why does the van not turn when the wheel turns?). After 7
hours of arse sitting we finally met our hosts for the week: Darko
Bakšić and Igor Jelinić. We went to slept in a luxurious community
centre, had a few drinks and some sleep.







**Jarvist**



I and Tetley flew out to Slovenia two days before the Croatian mission.
Easter surprise! We land in a snow storm. Instead of an hour and a half
drive to Tolmin we spend 4 hours in choosing the mountain pass that we
reckon will have the least snow on. We arrived in Tolmin at 1 AM in the
morning. Was still not too late for a few members of the
[JSPDT](http://www.pdtolmin.si/), waiting for us since 9 PM
with all the spirits and snacks. The mission continues in **Club Mink**,
where there was an Iron Maiden night. We somehow end our journey at
Kos's house at 5 AM. O, Men – We need sleep!

Tetley had rented a car, so we had our transport down to Croatia. We met
with others at the Slovenia/Croatia border, where it had started snowing
once more. Here we go again – driving by night on the snowy roads 40 -60
km/h.

We were a bit worried, that the plan A (going to Munižaba) will
collapse. I speak with Darko on the phone they were also late, due to
rgw snow. It was 10 PM, when we finally met with Darko and Igor. Of
course plan A was off, so straight to plan B, which was to stay in a
lovely old peoples centre (was empty at the time) and go caving next day
to Kite Gašečina.

We woke up in a lovely morning – sunny and white. Early rising, if we
want and go to set up a camp in Kita. The plan B was on, until just
before the cave entrance we were already stuck with our cars (too much
snow on the road, for a safe drive) the it started to snow really
heavily. After the discussion we all agreed that going down and camp
would be a bad idea - with over a metre of snow forecast. So, there it
was plan C, going to see a pretty cave down in the valley. We were a bit
sad, because we could not camp in any of those two caves…:( A, well –
next time!

Debeljača
---------

The next day I (James) wake up to a beautiful sight: sun is shining and
whispy clouds are rolling over the peaks of the Velebit mountains.
Inside the snoring of my fellow cavers sounds reassuring. Eventually we
manage to pack for the night's camping/surveying/bolting and head
towards Kita Gačešina. Unfortunately having gotten to the top of the
pit, it had started snowing again and the weather forecast was rather
apocalyptic. Faced with the prospect of spending the night underground
to find the entrance pit covered in snow and the van locked in snow we
decided to back off, even though Darko cooly informed us that -in case
of being snowed in- he did not have any personal issue with abbandoning
his car there, walking down the mountain and catching a bus to Zagreb.

So the decision was made to drive to Debeljača. This cave consists of a
20 m hang onto a sloping boulder field, which then opens onto the most
beautifully decorated passages and avens. Debeljača proved to be a
beautiful place to practice some cave photography and provided a
suitably varied selection of caving: a little SRT, a bit of climbing, a
bit of traverses, beautiful airy passages and most of all some
incredible decorations: huge stals, coralloids, transluscent crystals.
The cave ends in a chamber with some mud formations. We regrouped and
listened to our hosts playing their wind instruments (Darko a proficient
harmonica player and Igor a most impressive whistler, one could say he
truely controls the air flowing from his body!). At the end of the day
we visited a restaurant, ate and drank our weight in pork products and
spirits and went back to the community center.

The day proved to be different from the expected hardships of cave
exploration, but nevertheless very enjoyable. Most of all we realised
that our hosts were likeable, hospitable, friendly and most importantly
very proficient and safe cavers.It bodes well for the rest of the week!







**James KP**



The muddiest cave I have ever been to. It was clay, who sticks
everywhere. Going back out on rope was quite entertaining – cleaning the
rope in front of me, so the jammer had a grip. Beside that, beautiful
cave!







**Jana**







Gračac
------

The next day we visit Cerovačka cave: two beautiful show caves which are
located right under Murižaba: the destination of our original
exploration plans. The day consists of an utter stal-overload: how many
pretties can my mind cope with? Caves also contain some bits of animal
bones here and there: makes you think those animals must have been
pretty determined to get to where their bones lie.







**James KP**







Zadar
-----

In the evening we drive to Zadar. After visiting the water front with
its' LED disco floor and sea powered air organ, we meet with our hosts
in the Zadar speleological club: Livio and Marko. Tonight we sleep in a
youth hostel, to the relaxing sounds of Croatian folk band. Gergely and
Rik indulge in sweet company and sour wine 'till the small hours, whilst
the rest of the band enjoys a night sleeping under duvets on comfie
mattresses.







**James KP**







Jama Golubnjača
---------------

Today we visit a cave of which the Zadar club have recently resumed
exploration. When told that the entrance pitch is a 5m descent, we all
knock our head back and laugh. It turns out to be the most absurdly
complicated pitch to rig due to the fact that all descent protection is
above an overhanging lip. In an effort to avoid the rub point, the pitch
is rigged off a distinctly un-BMClike boulder, with a psychological
deviation. We all get down fairly well, but struggle on the way out.
Inside the cave is rather remarkable: ancient chambers with more stals
than you can shake a stick at (smash your helmet into?). Plenty of muddy
holes to crawl into (Gergely finds \~50m or so of new passage).
Definitely a fun cave: super-warm, beautifully decorated and with
potential for horizontal development.

In the evening we drive to Šibenik and meet our next host: Teo from the
Šibenik speleological club. We are hosted in the most luxurious caving
hut ever: fridge full of beer, comfortable mattresses upstairs and even
a bat infested loft! I seem to remember getting ludacrously
uber-ge-pissed. Might have done some singing... mhhh (maybe this tune
here: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55yCQOioTyY> ).







**James KP**



If Debeljača was the muddiest, this one is definitely the oldest cave I
have ever been to. The stals and other pretties were already in state of
decomposition. Here we also explore (croll) around a bit and find places
pure and untouchable. A super caving day with our hosts from Zadar.







**Jana**







Šibenik
-------

### Day One

Teo walked us around the Krka valley, visited two caves and loads of
beautiful waterfalls. The first destination we visited was the site of
one of the earliest hydro dams built in the world. After having been
ignored the armed guard at the entrance we got changed. this Deserves
Special Mention, as the cave we visited required no SRT and no
scrotting, peeps where therefore to express themselves sartorially: I
hope we have some pics of the amazing results. As well as Teo, we were
guided by Luka (Teo's son) and Teo's speleo-dog. Visited a rather pretty
cavern, devoid of the super-ornate decoration we had previously
encountered and ending in a charming lake: almost fell tempted to go for
a swim! Our next destination on the Krka valley was an ancient roman
fort which looked over a beauteous waterfall. MMHHH! Those lucky chaps
in the IX Legion must have had a whale of a time! Our final destination
for the day was a small watermill, it had been designed to take
advantage of a tufa (flow rock) cave flowing underground there. A short
cave, but truely bizarre: all the formations were root shaped and there
where the hairs of plants poking through: how weird?!

At the end of the day, back in Šibenik we visited a presentation on the
Sv. Mihovil club's (our hosts in Šibenik) trip to Kilimanjaro. Nice
music, pretty pictures, seemed like a barrel of fun! They had loads of
people sitting at the presentation, apparently the other hiking club in
Šibenik are interested in their colleagues travel! Mhhh... I should work
less and travel more methinks! Shortly after we enjoyed some pizza and
back to our beatiful beds. The details of this evening are more clearly
impressed in my mind: dancing to the radio, learning interesting
Croatian word (krmemlj means sleep \[as in the stuff in your eyes!\]).







**James KP**







### Day Two

Our first day of resting. We woke up in a beautiful, almost summer
morning. The amount of faf was of course predictable, specially living
in a caving hut next to the see. It was already really hot, when we
finally move our feet towards Šibenik (15 min walk). Historic town with
castle ruins on top of the hill. Walking with ice-cram in our hands
threw little narrow alleys it seems like we are on proper holidays. On
the way back we bought some Burek, sit next to see and enjoy the view.
We said goodbye to Šibenik and drove back towards Zadar, near Benkovac.

Mamet
-----

We wake up to a beatiful sunrise: cool air (for now!), the bivvy bags
more than comfortable. After a laid back breakfast we pack and start
ascending to the entrance of Mamet: a bell shaped open air pit made
famous by this mad Austrian basejumper:
<http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=b-VXvA5hSjs>.

Our group was pretty large: 5 of us (Jana, Jarv, Gergely, Tim and me )
from ICCC and 6 Croatians (Darko, Igor and two couples Slaven and Tihana
and X and Y), Jarv and Jana did not feel like freezing their buttskis at
the bottom of the pit and sweat their legsies on the prussic up so
decided to go for a walk. It was noon by the time we started descending
and positively sweltering. Darko rigged the route, adding a few bolts on
the early chossy part of the descent. After Darko Slaven followed suit
followed by me. The first 60-70 m are along the narrow part of the bell
shaped pit, lots of rebelays, kind of fun getting the descender nice and
hot, beautiful sights of the pit: you can see all the way to the bottom.
Worringly enough the bottom of the pit always looks the same distance.

At -60m a comfortable ledge is reached full of 10mm rawl bolts placed by
the basejump filming crew. I wait here with Slaven while Darko rigs the
rest of the route: rebelay under the overhang and a monster 130m single
drop off a super-solid looking Y hang on some more industrial size rawl
bolts. Eventually Tihana reaches me on the ledge and Slaven starts
descending. At some point Darko is shouting to Slaven in Croatian, I
look befuddled enough and Tihana translates for me: "Look down, can you
see Darko". "Ugh" - I reply - " where????". "Can't you see the light?".
Bloody Hell! That ant sized light is at the bottom of the cave? It's
miles away!!! Och well... soon enough it's my turn down.

Hanging rebelay above the 130 m hang is rather "interesting", Jeebus the
rope gets really small, and look at those tiny winy people! Soon enough
the vertigo is suppressed by the ludicrous amount of rope lifting
involved in feeding the fat 10.5 mm Marmet rope through the descender.
The not pass is negotiated in great style and last 30 m on 10mm rope go
pretty fast. At the bottom we wait \~ for everyone to make it down, keep
warm by doing laps of the pit, eat lots of nuts, look under boulders etc
etc. Soon enough the time to prussick comes: Darko and Slaven ascend as
fast as ferrets on speed and Tihana reminds me that she will only see
sunlight on the way out if I'm fast. It's pretty embarrassing to prussic
with an audience, but I cane it up as fast as I can. As soon as I reach
the ledge I holler "ROPE FREE" and start making my way out the next 70 m
in more relaxed style.

<span
class="frame lfloat">caving:photo\_archive/tours/2008%20-%20croatia/james%20kirkpatrick%20-%20cut%20wings--thumb.jpg</span>
I am prussicing just in my microfleece and the chest harness ends up
digging beautiful scars in my shoulders: Mamet has chopped off my wings!
While waiting for the rest of the gang to get out, we start a little
fire and pack up. By 8 pm we are all out and ready for the next chapter.







**James KP**



It is a huge hole - 55 x 45 m plus down 206! Hmmm….and there are 11 of
us going down and up again. If you add the time plus Darkos re-rigging,
then it is better for us two to go walking. We walked and climb around
this rocks around Mamet. Plus I manage to use more of my CatCam. Here is
a short movie from photos made on CatCam:
<http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCe_djQkBg>

The whole area looks very interesting - pretty much it is limestone all
around. Definitely must be more caves around. So we start looking for
them. Surprisingly there are millions of holes who do not go anywhere.
But we manage to find one cave, very close to Mamet. We came back and
saw Tim going – down and Igor was still there as well. It is going to be
a long waiting! Igor then said: “You know, I would not walked around
much, there are still possible mine fields around!” Hmmmmm…What!? So, we
just spend 3 hours walking in “possible” mine fields!? Great! It was
getting dark and cold and still about 5 peoples to come out. We find a
shelter and make fire, to warm ourselves while waiting. It was 9 PM when
we start walking all the way back down to the valley.

Teo invite us to his Spelo Camp, just near by. So, we decided to go
there and spend the night there. He draw us a map, so it is going to be
easier for us to find it. He said we should just follow the painted
foothpath sighs. We spend hour looking for those, we were dehydrated and
tired. Finally the sound of water and in tents in the distance.







**Jana**







Spelo Camp
----------

So we get in the van and start driving to Bijele Vode, where the Sv.
Mihovil club have a training camp. By the time we reach the car park
it's bloody late, we are all hungry and dehydrated. Meandering through
the bush is definitely not maximum fun and we have difficulty following
the path. Personally I am preparing for sleeping under a stone/driving
to a village and getting some water. Eventually we get to a beautiful
place: waterfalls, a great bivouac under an overhanging ledge, a big
fire, food, drink and human company! WOW! much better than sleeping
under a stone! We eat and soon most of us are in bed.







**Jarvist**



I think we all slept like babies. We would sleep more if Jarv and I
would not sleep just below the climbing wall, where keen fresh cavers
were already getting ready to start practicing their SRT. Basically that
morning we were just relaxing, washing our stinky feet in the river and
getting ready for the long, long way to Slovenia – Tolmin.







**Jana**







Tolmin
------

Arrived at 8 PM quite tired, where Tetely and Rick looked so fresh. We
were hoping to do some van cleaning that night, but instead we rather
went to a picking place near Soča, where young JSPDT team was waiting
for us with freshly caught fishes straight from Soča.

Tetely and Rick left Croatia on Friday. They went caving with JSPDT to
Pološka jama.

We had to wake up at 8 AM and start cleaning our super dirty and messy
van. Packing and cleaning till 11, when we left Tolmin and finish hour
splendid caving holidays.







**Jana**







The End
-------

Speaking on the behalf of ICCC, I would like to thank our most lovely
hosts, for the time and knowledge given to us. Special thank to Darko
Bakšić for organising this absolutely amazing trip for us. Hope to see
you all again for more caving actions!
