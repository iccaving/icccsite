The Imperial Democratic People's Republic of Caving has once again demonstrated it's superiority by conducting "democratic" elections far more convincing than many others that have taken place this year. Despite having no consitutional limits on re-election and a voting system based almost entirely on how much people have had to drink the caving club has avoided the ugly stain of autocracy by electing fresh new figureheads.

Congratulations to the new committee:
