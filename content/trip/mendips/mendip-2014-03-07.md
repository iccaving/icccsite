Title: Mendips III
Date: 2014-03-07
Location: mendips
Summary: In a brilliant display of cunning and subterfuge we organised a trip to the Mendips to conincide with Jarv's surprise birthday celebration. At long last we managed to complete the short round trip in Swildons on Saturday finding that on our previous attempts we had been mere metres from the correct way on. In the evening we joined the eclectic gathering of Jarv's friends and family and made a sizeable dent in the huge array of delcious treats and alcohol. On Sunday we relaxed on a sunny Priddy green until it was time to head home.
