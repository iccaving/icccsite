Title: Yorkshire II
Date: 2018-11-16
Location: yorkshire
Summary: A disgustingly competent trip into Notts Pot saw teams down the Centre, Left, and Adamsons'. We all go to the exchange point and no one ran out of rope or forgot any vital bits of equipment. No, really. On Sunday we bimbled back and forth in a surprisingly dry Notts 2. The scaffolding was appraised as unsafe by a civil engineering student.
