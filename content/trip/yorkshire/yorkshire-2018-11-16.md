Summary: A disgustingly competent trip into Notts Pot saw teams down the Centre, Left, and Adamsons'. We all go to the exchange point and no one ran out of rope or forgot any vital bits of equipment. No, really. On Sunday we bimbled back and forth in a surprisingly dry Notts 2. The scaffolding was appraised as unsafe by a civil engineering student.

### Notts Pot: {{ DATE=2018-11-17; CAVE=Notts Pot; }}

A disgustingly smooth trip into Notts. Jackhal and I were rigging down left. He kindly volunteered me to do the rigging so I was determined to set a good pace. I think I managed to stay ahead of our novices most of the time. I heartily recommend left as a route to rig. Its very fun. Airy traverses, big swings, nipping down into windows. 

We arrived at the bottom first. Somehow I had an entire 20m rope spare so either I had rigged very conservatively or the rope lengths in the version of the CNCC guide we were using are a bit generous. Still better than the other way round.

We had deliberately not taken the ropes for the bottom section as we normally have enough faff and trouble organising the shallow exchange so we sat and waited. The water levels were extremely low, with no stream coming the left route. I was worried we'd be waiting a long time and I went over to point out where Diss would drop in from Centre when she arrived.

"She should appear high up just about - oh, there she is. Ayyyooohhhhh!"

Diss carefully rigged the final hang no rope to spare and all of Centre zipped down. Just as we got around to worrying about where Adamson's was a rope dropped down onto our heads with a Jimmy close behind. We began to kick ourselves for not bringing the bottom ropes as it seemed we had just managed a trouble free exchange. Still I had an extra credit assignment for this trip.

I knew there was a window from Adamsons route where you can see people asc/descending the Left route and I wanted to photo it. I handed out some flashes, 2 for Left and one with me for Adamsons. At the last minute DW suggested that he thought the window was from Centre into Left. Trusting his normally excellent memory I changed plans and started heading out Centre. As I neared the top, windowless, I hear Diss and DKP exchange greetings through the window that is definitely between Left and Adamsons. Bother. Another trip into Notts for me then.

I waited in the entrance chamber as various groups arrived and left. Confident that we'd got the important people out (only Perry and Jackhal left) I headed out.

## Sunday

### Notts Pot 2: {{ DATE=2018-11-18; CAVE=Notts Pot 2; }}

Cheeky little bimble in Notts 2. Downstream to where it gets grim. Upstream to where it gets grim. Fun was had by all, many marvelled at the scaff, some photos taken etc. Classic.
