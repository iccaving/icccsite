## Friday

Alex had told his friend 'Julia' wanted to come caving with us, but when we arrived at the NPC we found it was all a ploy and we were attacked by a small, extraordinarily violent Cecilia, who had just moved to Manchester to help the Machines in the war against Humanity.

### King Pot: {{ DATE=2018-04-14; CAVE=King Pot; }}

Seeing the fairly full Swinsoms Simpsto exhange trip I decided to siphon off a few choice people to descend King Pot. For this task I selected Alex Seaton (President of the Brown Rose Caving and Potholing Club), and the two latest models of Dubz brother. I instructed the Dubz to pack the rope in the morning and left them to it. I was briefly concerned when they mislaid a rope for about 15 minutes, both swearing it was 'just there' a few minutes ago, but we ended up with three bags and that seemed like the right order of magnitude.

With just us 4 we were quickly away and tramping towards East Kingsdale. On our way past the farm we spotted the new farmers, and asked if we could continue up to King. "No bother" came the reply and continue we did. We found the entrance with no trouble and Jimmy, who was our designated rigger, spent several years meticulously donning his gloves. Once suitably sheathed he slithered down the entrance climb as I reassured him that it's much easier on the way up. 

We practiced a sort of speed rigging where Jimmy would rig as fast and terribly as he could and I would correct any deadly rigging as I followed, though this did not often prove necessary. We were quick through the blasted rift and onwards to the pre-T crawl. Just past the dodgy traverse (for which we decided to use the in-situ rope, despite bringing our own) there was a brief argument between the Dubz as to which bag the next rope was in. I instructed them both to go ahead whilst I waited for Alex and to have it sorted by the time we caught up. On the other side of the crawl they had apparently decided something about the ropes we were carrying as the chat had turned more jovial. Davey took a lightish bag and wiggled in, I followed, laden only with a few kilograms of nickel metal hydride, and Alex and Jimmy shared the load of the final full bag at the rear.

We passed the rescue spot and already the drill damage is becoming quite subtle, worn smooth by bums and feet. It is also lower down in the rift than I remember. I've never struggled with the T-shaped passage and this time was no different. Davey popped out, using the in-situ rope to swing around, and I followed. We regrouped and continued.

Christ, it's a long streamway that follows. The Queensway. The survey would suggest its about a kilometre and it definitely feels at least that. It is neither easy nor hard, mostly it is just long. It had taken us just over an hour to get to the far side of the T-shaped and I think it took us almost another hour for this streamway. We finally reached Canutes crawl and Emma's pitch on the other side.

Whilst Davey rigged, Alex disappeared into a tiny inlet. He reemerged some time later covered in white paste and clutching a small formation he had found on the floor. Apparently it's 'cave coral' formed by percolating water in a static pool. As Davey reached the bottom of the pitch he screamed "JAMES YOU PYSCHOPATH". It trned out this was because he had hit the stopper knot a metre off the floor. This, I think, is preferable to not hitting a stopper knot any meters off the floor. With the situation defused we continued.

Beyond Emma's the pitches seem to fly by. King Henry hall is a bizarre place, a huge pile of rocks that you must climb up and then redescend on the other side. We had to desperately persaude Alex not to push a huge rock that was perched at the top of the rubble.  

Finally we were at Elizabeth. Jimmy rigged down. I descended and was dismayed at how wet it was. In a fabric oversuit I was not looking forward to the ascent.

At the bottom both Dubz bruvs immediately dissapeared in opposite directions. Jimmy inserted himself into a sump, and Dave was scaling Jane's pitch. I checked my watch and decided that we did not have time to get to the master streamway so I called the rabid brothers back. Davey opened a block of marzipan and I told him we had to eat it all or else it would just dissolve on the trip out. Alex and I had a few bites each but the majority was consumed by the Dubz. Apprently it contains 1700 calories per 100g. More than enough to get out of King.

I ascended first, getting Davey to pull the rope out of the waterfall as I ascended. This was remarkabley effective. I assume Alex got them to do the same, and both Dubz were in PVC (wipe clean exteriors are an optional extra that I decided was worth it when purchasing my Dubz) and also both love grim ascents in waterfalls.

At the top we agreed the general strategy of Alex and I staying a pitch ahead and the Dubz derigging. However they were quick enough that they basically kept up with us (we did do a small amount of photography as well). As we left Jimmy grumbled about marzipan poisoning and Davey reassured him that there is probably not enough cyanide in marzipan to kill.

The top of Emma's pitch has a nice straw chamber to look at if you traverse over the pitch. Alex and I had a look whilst waiting for the Dubz but by the time I had set up my camera and flashes they had already derigged the pitch and were now waiting for me. A few flashes and we were off again.

We arrived at the T-shaped again and discussed strategy. It was simple. Davey and Jimmy would take the bags, Alex and I would tart about at the back. Davey inserted himself and made a complete mess of the entry, I think at one point bending his knee the wrong way in a desperate attempt to brute force his way through. It was very funny to watch. Jimmy went next, slightly more elegantly than Davey but still making a lot of drama about the whole thing. I went in next, taking the time to free Jimmy's bag that he had wedged deep in the rift in order to spite me I assume. Finally Alex clambered in and he was extremely pleased when I turned around, told him to stop in a really uncomfortable position, and took photos of his pained expression.

We proceeded slowly through. I don't know what happened to Davey as he quickly seemed to be singing somewhere in the distance. Thrutch by thrutch we neared the end of our toil. I defintely did not drop the spare batteries from my oversuit pocket, and Alex did not spend 10 minutes trying to retrieve them from the depths of the rift.

We clawed our way up the final few pitches and obstacles and I emerged into glorious bright sunlight. The other 3 appeared one by one and we made our way down hill, concerned that we slightly late. Free from confined space I joked that I would write in my trip report about the Dubz brothers bickering about who had the nicest toes (inspired by them showing off their bizarely different feet that morning), as an example of some of the banter they had been spewing all day in the cave. They immediately proceeded to actually have an argument about who had the nicest toes.

As it turned out the others had been having an interesting time anyway so weren't concerned about us.

### Simpsons Pot: {{ DATE=2018-04-14; CAVE=Simpsons Pot; }}

Ah, the Simpson's-Swinsto exchange, a classic Kingsdale day out that never seemed to go very well. Either the [water is a bit too deep](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2014-12-30.html) or I have a [splitting headache](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2015-09-18.html) or the [slit pitch is just a bit too tight](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2016-12-16.html). Still, surely it couldn't go wrong this time?

We opted not to rig Valley Entrance, and headed up the hill in vague sunshine. I lead the Swinsto group over to their entrance, and then Arun, Fiona and I plunged into Simpsons. It's as pleasant as always, with a slightly too long entrance crawl leading to the five steps. With only 20 m of rope, you must rig conservatively, and Arun had to help me take some slack out so we could reach the bottom. There's plenty of Eurospeleo rope in situ for most of the short 10 m pitches and the traverse - you need rope for the pitch down to the duck and everything after it, so we ended up leaving loads of rope in various places as encountered pre-rigged pitches.

The duck was quite committing - real full body immersion, and on the other side I made my classic joke "At least we won't be coming out this way " [Ed: they were to come out this way.] We met some old boys coming out from a bounce trip who claimed not to be good enough to be in a club, but I suspect they were tweaking our noses slightly. The tangle of rope leading up to the Swinsto Great Aven pitch was less intimidating than usual, and the beautiful flowstone at the pitch head was a fine sight, unusual in a UK cave.

We abseiled down the great aven to resounding silence, arriving around 1445. The others were not yet here. I poked around a bit, finding a way on straight ahead, but then realised that the way to Swinsto was a free climb down to the water. A tall waterfall bars the way up to where Swinsto and Slit Pitch come in.

Instead of getting cold, we decided to check out the Kingsdale Master Cave from this side. I'd never been, and after a few wet crawls we quickly got into a lovely stomping streamway. All too soon it was over, and we were at some pre-rigged ropes heading up to Valley entrance. So close to the surface, but not quite. We returned to the Great Aven to wait. It was 1515, and we resolved to leave at 1600. Many whistle blasts and 'Eh-ohs' later, and there was no sign of them, so we reluctantly turned round, prussiking slowly up the Great Aven.

The way out was quick, with Arun derigging almost as fast as we could cave. The duck was cold, the five steps tough (though Fiona handled them with ease this time) and the entrance crawl a bit twatty. On the surface was glorious sunshine, and we sat for a bit, drying off. Fion and I went to sit by Swinsto, and I went to the first pitch to blow my whistle. Arun went to the lip of the hill and looked down at the minibus. He had a hurried conversation with Diss and Cecilia which led us to believe Perry and Jack were derigging and everything was fine. We ambled down the hill and met up with them.

It turns out that the water had been ferocious on one pitch, and Diss and Cecilia opted to go out Valley Entrance (fortunately pre-rigged, though not by us!) whilst Perry and Jack came out Swinsto to rescue them (assuming that Valley Entrance was not rigged). It was unclear whether they were derigging Swinsto. We got changed at a leisurely pace, and after an hour or so we saw them running down the hill at high speed. I couldn't work out why they were in such a hurry, so we ambled over to say hi and realised that they were on a desparate mission to save Cecilia and Diss, who were fortunately in no danger. After a little chat, we peeled them out of their oversuits, fed them apple pies, Fosters and whisky and then watched as the King team came down the hill, having had a great trip.

Dinner was delicious chilli with rice paste.

### Swinsto Hole: {{ DATE=2018-04-14; CAVE=Swinsto Hole; }}

### Heron Pot: {{ DATE=2018-04-15; CAVE=Heron Pot; }}

### Swinsto Pull Through: {{ DATE=2018-04-15; CAVE=Swinsto Hole > Valley Entrance; }}

Swinsto was left rigged after yesterday's trip, and initially the Dubz Bruvs volunteered to climb up from Valley Entrance, derigging as they went. This sounded great, so Rhys, Fiona and I planned a trip to Illusion  Pot. However, just as we were about to leave, Perry remembered that although he hadn't derigged the ropes, he had derigged the deviations, leaving one pitch right in the full force of the water. Unsure how bad it was, a pull-through derig seemed the safest options. Rhys and I had done plenty of pull-throughs when canyoning, and it seemed safest if we joined the Dubz Bruvs, literally showed them the ropes and have a fun trip to boot.

We packed a nice 60 m from the NPC, and ambled to Valley entrance. Here we met a lady with a distraught dog - apparently her husband and daughter were underground. Inside Valley entrance we quickly met the husband and a very young girl, who proudly announced that we were inside a dustbin - a reference to the lid and plastic pipe entrance to the cave. Rhys rigged our rope just in case the in situ tat vanished, and we exited the cave to begin the long walk up the hill.

As we climbed, we discussed our tactics and whistle signals. We decided the first three would abseil on the pre-rigged rope. The third person would clip one end of the pull through rope to them and abseil with it, ensuring that it reached the ground, or clipping the end to a bolt to avoid the last person abseiling off the end. The final person would derig the pre-rigged rope, abseil on the pull-through rope, feeding out the other half (the 'pull cord') from a tackle sack on their back. The pull-through rope would be biner blocked as usual, and fed through two bolts for back-up.

After a few practice pitches which went quite well, we got to the big one. Rhys agreed to be the last one down, and I plummeted through the water. I wouldn't have enjoyed prussiking up this way, though we'd deliberately left the deviation out as we were only going down. Soon Rhys joined me on the spray soaked ledge and we discussed again how we'd do this rebelay.  Rhys took a while detangling the ropes (it had got very complicated at this point) but he was quickly down. The few remaining pitches were rigged by the Dubz Bruv's, who did a great job, and then we were back in the Great Aven. Quickly, we exited the cave and were back on the surface: 2.5 hrs from Swinsto to Valley Entrance, not bad!

The Swinsto pull-through is lovely and high recommended if you have a chance. PVC is probably useful given it's very wet, and the split pitch requires a bit of thought so that everyone has somewhere safe to clip in to - either that, or take two 60 m ropes so you can rig both.

Rope rescued, we went back to the Pennine for egg fried rice paste, and hurried home. A great weekend of caving!
