## Saturday

### Penyghent - Friday the 13th Series: {{ DATE=2018-06-09; CAVE=Penyghent Pot;2 }}

Pen-y-ghent to Friday the 13th


‘Are you...intrigued?’ 

The modest proposal by Clare was to have a look down the Friday the 13th series in Penyghent. I agreed at the time knowing very little about it and without ever having been into Penyghent at all.

A month passed and I read the description in NFTFH several times. I was fascinated by the description of the ‘waterlogged struggle’ particularly as it is preceded by a flat out cobble floored crawl which ‘deteriorates’ into said struggle.

The weekend arrived along with Clare and I was fairly relieved to hear that she was not interesting in diving the four metre sump through to the final section of Friday the 13th.  It is only another 50 metres of passage and I am not such a Book Of Death purist as to insist that we do it.

The logistics were unclear until Saturday morning where after tea, breakfast, and faff I wandered into the common room to find that Andy had arranged everything. I should have been far more alarmed than I was. Oh sweet summer child. 

Andy would take a team to Brackenbottom and rig to the traditional bottom of Penyghent whilst Clare and I would head up with the Dale Head team and approach Penyghent from the other direction. A classic pincer move. The aim was to give the riggers enough time to get down so that Clare and I could zip all the way down and into the extensions. The price of this proposal? Why, the derig of course. 

At the picturesque Dale Head Clare and I made our preparations for the walk over the fell. We decided against wearing our neoprene for the hour long walk, instead carrying our caving gear and minimal tackle. We waited for the Dale Head and FOUL teams to depart and set off ourselves. 

The walk is lovely. Not much elevation to gain and I think one of the quieter ways up towards Penyghent on such a nice day. As we neared looming prominence of Penyghent some 100 meters above us we considered our options. We could skirt around the bottom and walk to the cave. Orrrrr we could hide our bags, nip up to the top, and come back down again to continue the walk. We went for option two.

We hid the bags behind a dry stone wall and covered them with dry grass to disguise them and then marched up to the peak. We got a couple of comments on the way up about our footwear, wellies and neoprene socks, (‘Them’s not hiking boots’) and about the headtorch tangling around my neck (‘How long are you planning to be out here?’).  It was further than I expected with a small walk to actually get to the trig point but we were up in just over 10 minutes and back to our bags in just over 20. 

Now we had been to the top of Penyghent, it was time to go to the bottom. We continued on the path, veering off into the fields at the appropriate dry stone wall. It didn’t take us long to find the entrance. We completed the unpleasant task of entombing ourselves in neoprene and PVC and were very glad to be in the cool air of the cave.

The 250 metre crawl is not too bad on the way in. We took frequent breaks to adjust our double kneepads, and my neoprene gloves were I think unnecessary in the summer conditions. A flat out section signals the end so we stashed our extra kneepads on a shelf and pressed onto into easier passage.

The first small pitch drops into a ‘stooping’ passage which is just tall enough for Clare to walk in irritatingly often. We passed a fellow troglodyte at a deep pool exchanging mumbled hellos. At the second pitch the pleasant cave begins in earnest and we dropped the pitches fairly rapidly. We pass more people from this other party, snatching a quick conversation (‘You flew all the way from Singapore for this?!’). 

The inevitable happened and we stumbled into the back of our party, queing at a pitch head. We said hello to Mr Jack, Jan and Andy. I introduced myself to a Nottingham caver that Andy snatched from the YSS. According to Mr Jack this was awkward as they had been having a nice silent trip up until them. Some faff involving Andy pulling all the ropes out of every bag and repacking them occured but we were not much delayed in our descent.

We reached the top of the 10th pitch where Clare and I were supposed to leave the others and do battle with Friday the 13th. An awkward looking climb to a tube presented itself but we decided that it can’t be the way as it doesn’t match the description and the climb looks really sketchy (it helps if you read the correct bit of the description as it turns out). Andy helped by doing the climb and declaring the way on to be horrible and therefore correct. We thanked Andy for his assistance and abandoned our attempt to abandon our trip.

In the tube a short crawl over awkward ribs of rock lead very quickly to Eerie Pot. We had brought ropes to rig the traverse over the top but we found the in-situ rope to be adequate. The ropes lead straight across the pitch, requiring a bold leap of faith to access a tube on the other side of the pitch. Zip lining it is an option of course, once someone has had a look at the bolts on the other side.

Here the trial begins. We lay still for a few moments staring at the crawl ahead. I read aloud the description to Clare and we shuddered in sick anticipation. Unwilling to show weakness we both agreed to continue. Willing to show some weakness we both agreed to leave the tackle sack here and hope that the final pitch is rigged. I lead into the crawl.

It begins hands and knees but very quickly the roof lowers and you are forced to your stomach. The floor is covered in large cobbles which alternately roll and jam beneath you as you claw forwards. For the most part it is possible to change the way your head is facing and so is not too intimidating. We reptate along, stopping a couple of times to reconsider our motives and giggle manically. The Book of Death describes this as continuing for 10 to 12 minutes, which is about right. The Book of Death describes the deterioration into a waterlogged struggle but does not offer guidance on how long that lasts other than to imply that it eventually ends.

The deterioration into waterlogged struggle is smooth. The passage does not change at all other than to subtly fill with water. In some ways it makes the crawl easier, as you are now slightly buoyant. In most ways it makes the crawl deeply unpleasant. It gets slightly smaller and there are more places where you must commit to a head direction. Where you can turn your head you must pass your face underwater to do so.

Half way along a column blocks the way and I needed to superman my way through. It felt commiting and left me unable to hold my head out of the water but there was no way to turn around. I assume Clare had an easier time of it but she was a collection of scraping and splashing noises somewhere behind me at this point and neither of us were keen to waste time talking.

I have no idea how long it took us to get through but it was certainly long enough. We dragged ourselves out of the water and into a final flat our section. It thankfully quite quickly became a hands and knees crawl and joined a junction where it was possible to sit down. 

We had a rest and examined a plastic tub of peanuts and raisins that we found there. I didn’t open them. Even in a sealed container it seems rather optimistic to hope they will last that long. 

Continuing we found ourselves, once again submerged, in the Crawl of Cthulu, a wide and ominous canal. There was enough airspace at the top to keep your torso mostly dry by doing an awkward shuffle on extended fingertips. Initially it was eerily silent but as our wakes met the walls a cacophony of wet slopping noises rebounded. Water sloshing on ceilings is not a reassuring sound and I found it quite disconcerting as it got louder and louder the further in we went.

It seemed to go on for a while. Occasionally the ceiling would lower leaving perilously little space above the water. I mumbled back to Clare that I was not sure how far in I was happy to go if continued like this. She giggled an agreement but coincidentally we sighted dry land and collapsed onto it. A quick review of the survey suggested that we were oh so close to the final pitch (Jason’s) and we decided that we had to see it through.

Out of the water the crawl soon enlarged to walking passage, and there ahead was the pitch. It was quickly obvious that there was no way down, no in situ rope. We peered over the edge at the silty sump and convinced ourselves that it wasn’t worth it anyway. There is no way on at the bottom other than the four metre freedive that we had no intention of doing.

We backtracked to a sitting spot and ate quietly with the long trip out on our minds. I convinced myself for the moment that it would be all plain sailing once we got back on the other side of Pyscho. Just one, truly grim, obstacle between us and the surface. And some pitches and climbs and crawls and derigging. But only one truly grim thing.

Clare led the way back. Cthulu was not so bad on the way out, it’s disgusting noises already faded to normality. In a sign of things to come though I found my arms already tiring and settled several times for semi-floating despite the water that this let into my wetsuit in order to rest them.

Clare was out of sight by the time I passed the raisins and fed myself into the Pyscho. Her distant scraping noises were reassuring though and I found her round a couple of corners, sliding into the struggle. It is surprising how much more tired I felt already. The crawl was significantly harder this time, with a lot more spluttering and splashing. We took a few rests in the water, which we had not really done on the way in. 

The flat out section beyond the water was harder still. I was quite used to the water now and particularly the buoyancy. To drag against the ground with my full body weight was an insult. Clare announced that she had gotten to the end and I made the final effort. We lay for a while overlooking Eerie Pot. We both decided we would never go back, as you must after any grim bit of cave. But that was the hard bit over, right? Now just plain sailing up the pitches. 

I took the bag and we ziplined back across into the comparatively pleasant crawl to 10th pitch head. We did the dodgy climb and made our way up the nice streamway. We found the 9th pitch and made the plan. I would derig till my bag was full, then Clare would take over. As Clare prepared to climb I found the sling that Andy had planned to use to signify that his group was above and that we could derig. Their ropes from the 10th pitch were gone and the sling had moved quite far so we decided that it was probably still fine to derig. Andy is a resourceful person anyway.

The pitches are fairly easy. However there is a surprisingly forgettable and surprisingly large amount of actual caving in between the pitches. Clare helped me with the bag at several of the harder climbs and I offered a shoulder at one particularly tall and slippery climb.

The bag filled at some point and Clare took over derigging. I went ahead a pitch. I’m not sure which pitch it was but I was quite grateful that Clare was distracted below me as it took me a long time and a couple of rests to pass the rebelay. A very humbling experience. At the top I waited and sang to myself until at the very edge of my hearing I thought I heard Clare very quietly say the word ‘help’. I shouted back ‘HELP?!’. A mumbled reply sounded a bit like yes so I unclipped the bag and abseiled back down to find Clare looking up at me from the middle of one of the many tricky climbs. I offered a hand and she pulled herself up. I nipped back up the pitch, humility forgotten, finding it significantly easier without a bag.

Some caving later we arrived at the bottom of the big pitch. I must’ve looked quite out of it because Clare suggested we have a break. She then produced two cereal bars that she had found in an abandoned glove somewhere in the cave. One was quite palatable, the other sodden. We ate both. 

We were now at bag number three. I offered to take two bags, if Clare was happy to continue derigging. People very rarely refuse that sort of offer and Clare was no exception. I began the slow haul upwards.

The next few pitches are either connected or extremely close so it was gratifying to find ourselves at the top of the second pitch after the an exhausting struggle upwards. This was not aided by the belay placement which favour rope wrapped around razor sharp flakes 1 meter below the pitch head. Maybe there is just one pitch like that.

The long stooping passage between the second and first pitches had just enough water that dragging two hydroplaning tackle sacks behind me was moderately comfortable. Even so we took several breaks. I think mostly because of my need to occasionally stretch my back from the stooping, though I think Clare appreciated it too.

The first and final pitch passed we sat at the top packing rope and packing away srt gear and generally faffing. Then we rounded the corner and sat again redonning our extra kneepads, putting off the inevitable. “Let’s get the fuck out of here” one of us said. Though this would prove easier said than done.

I was extremely tired and my knees were completely fucked despite the approximately 2cm of neoprene covering them. Apart from the pain in my knees and arms I was surprised to find my core strength failing. Not that I have a strong core, just that I don’t think I have ever crawled and stooped to the point that it hurt.

My world shrank to 4 points of painful pressure, hands and knees, sloshing water, and shimmering brown water in front of my hung head. I attempted to sink into a zen like state of unconscious movement though as Clare pointed out I was quite bad at this because I kept complaining about things and manically giggling. The crawl progressed slowly. We would take a break whenever one of us collapsed into the water. Rising after a few moments, motivated by the thought of being so nearly out. 

And then after an eternity we were. Some final combined tactics saw us and all of the bags out of the final grovel and climb and into the glorious sunshine.

I desperately stripped off the top half of my neoprene and basked. We walked down towards Brackenbottom as the sun set to be met by Jack and Sandeep and a vast amount of midges who were the most keen to see us.

I think I would go back. I’d like to see the other side of that sump.
