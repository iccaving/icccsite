### Loads a Cavers

## Saturday

### Stream - Gaping Ghyll: Jarv, Lyndon, Deep

comes a time in every man's life when he is suddenly faced by a question of
just what in hells name he is doing. For me this came as I abseiled down the
Steel pipe entrance shaft to Stream. We had wandered over Lekk fell for a good
hour, over-taking the fell wanderers with their polystyrene seats as we
slogged along with our heavy rope. The view was glorious, with the Yorkshire
peaks dotted around &amp; fluffy clouds in a deep blue sky. The main Gaping
Ghyll drop was beautiful, with a far old stream running over the lip &amp;
down the 80m shaft. With such a pleasent sunny winter day, seeing the perfect
circle of sky shrink to a pinprick as I abseiled down something barely bigger
than my shoulders belayed to a rotting wooden post all seemed rather perverse
- why on earth was I going underground again?

](/caving/photo_archive/trips/2006-02-17%20-%20yorkshire/IMGP1052.html) But of
course, a few minutes later I was back into my stride. There is something very
particular about leading at the front of a trip, though the caves in the UK
are extremely well explored, you can't help but think you're finding this for
the first time yourself. For the most part you still have to trust your nose
and poke your head down cracks in the floor &amp; around boulders to find
something likely. After more than a few minutes of solo exploration, I tutted
to the waterfall and climbed back up the entrance pitches to shout at
'Brokeback' Lyndon &amp; Sandeep to get a move on. This was going to be a
faff-tastic trip.

Next pitch was easily found - follow streamway, suddenly find yourself
presented with a BLOODY BIG HOLE after executing a few exciting clamber downs,
backup &amp; find the roof-high traverse over the top &amp; to a nice Y-hang.
I rigged to Y-hang, Deep dropped the pitch. Around this time, we were caught
up by the abortive Diahedral party, who had picked up a NPC/CUCC member called
Mark, found wandering around Lekk fell looking for a bit of underground
action.

Pitch series obvious; some nice formations on way back up. Middle pitch was
distinctly wet on take-off. Rope was a little short for last chamber, but by
swinging around &amp; standing upon a boulder, a way to get off the rope was
found. Once freed of a cavers weight, the elastically nylon statched it back
up, leaving it just within jumping distance - a close call!

Next chamber consisted of a gauntlet under multiple waterfalls, plenty of
practice in underground sprinting. Waterfalls are depicted so romanatically,
always beautiful sheets of water with damsels behind them. The reality is
rather less pleasent, cold water falling from such a height is going pretty
fast &amp; hard by the time it reaches you, inevitably forcing itself down the
back of your oversuit &amp; jarring you to the core! But I guess after all
those damsel daydreams, a cold shower is called for.

dash to try and meet Bar Pot lads, when in a chamber faced with either sliding
between rocks to your right or continuing along what becomes an ever deepening
canal, go for the rock - the canal leads nowhere &amp; will merely fill your
wellies with rather unpleasent brown water! Ahem. Got to the main chamber with
no sign of Bar party; so marvelled at the constantly-snaking waterfall
a Christmas pudding at the far-warmer Bar T-junction. The main chamber is
truly impressive; the largest in Britain and with a beautiful boulder-strewn
floor. It gives off the feeling of intruding on some Suburbia-living giant's
tacky water feature, a bug clambering over gravel while dodging the torrential
trickle from above.

Exit in two 'pulse trains' (ahh, you can tell we're IC cavers..) of three
&amp; four cavers, smoothly done except for the lack of a derigging spanner!
Not an enormous issue, as cave fully P-bolted, but some of the loaded Maillons
were pretty unpleasent for Tom to undo by hand.

Emerged into a beautiful clear-skyed night, the stars looking splendid to our
darkness-adapted eyesight. Tom had a bottle of some delicious exilior from
which we all sipped. It may have only been lemon squash, but after the dead
sheep put oneself off drinking the water, it felt so nice. Moor was scrunchy
underfoot, the puddles shattering as our heavy wellies clumped home. Long
bimble back to Clapham was euphoric, Owls hooting as they hunted around the
lake - stars fantastically clear. Back in time to quickly change beside the
frozen-up minibus, before rescuing the others from the pub &amp; attempting an
ad-hoc defrosting of the windshield before returning to the NPC.

was on the menu, and everything was going so well until Lyndon made the
mistake of taking counsel from Sandeep on the subject of how much chilli
powder to add. It was barely edible for the rest of us, though we struggled on
regardless! Probably the first time ever that there's been slop left over...

### Jingling (Not Aquamole): Jan, Tom, Rik, Deep

If you thought that you knew what faff was, it was just redefined by this
trip.

### Not the Waterfalls Walk &amp; Bernies: Everyone Else

Disgusted at the horror of having to pay over three quid each to walk the
Waterfalls with car-loads of fat Americans for whome the walk truly was
'Warning: Extremely Strenuous', we set off up a footpath towards Kingsdale.
Investigating the fields we usually zoom past in the Minibus, we found
ourselves (entirely by chance) wandering in the direction of the Waterfalls
past quizzical sheep. Finding ourselves at a rather challenging gradient, we
clambered down in our walking boots &amp; rather shockingly found ourselves
deposited on the disgustingly manicured (concrete layed down on top of the
bare limestone - yuk!) Waterfalls path. Stumbling back towards Ingleton, we
scowled at the unfortunately empty ticket gatehouse.

Back in the safety &amp; comfort of Bernies, we finalised what to spend our
equipment budget on, while quaffing pints of tea. Left Yorkshire as dusk fell
- with 10'000 strong swarms of black birds circling above in amazing ever-
changing patterns.
