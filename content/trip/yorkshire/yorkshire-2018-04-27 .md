## Friday
I was in Plymouth visiting my dad this week and spent a lot of time in the great outdoors instead of finishing off my essay. I got back to London at 10pm on Thursday and had all of Friday morning to finish it off and make all the figures before the trip (quite a lot to do in hindsight). I told myself I couldn’t go if I didn’t get it all finished and printed before kit packing time – the deadline was the following Monday morning. It was a manic rush, I got up at 6:30 and managed to get it all done by 2ish, probably not to the greatest standard but I’d had enough of it at this point. Into uni at some time to print off. It took me four attempts to get it right, bloody printer. But it’s okay, I was done before the bus was ready to leave and so was rewarded with a weekend of luxury at Bull Pot farm caving hut, Lancashire. Wait, what? Not Yorkshire? What is this madness?

The journey was awful. So much traffic. We didn’t get to the hut until 2am so no festivities this evening. Just pain and sleep.

### Pippikin Pot: {{DATE=2018-04-28; CAVE=Pippikin Pot;}}

I'd first done Pippikin [as a novice in 2014](https://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2014-03-21.html). I remember it being tight and challenging, especially the final rift to the stemple.

### Lancaster Hole: {{DATE=2018-04-28; CAVE=Lancaster Hole;}}
We hadn’t been to Easegill in a while and many of us were keen to try out some new entrances, namely Cow and Pippikin, with a trip down Lancaster to accommodate our token SRT beginner, Georgia. I had vaguely thought I’d go down Cow, or Pip at a push, but Jarvist’s description made me think I may literally not fit in Pip so I was dubious. I was also heavily reliant on Ibuprofen for my functioning today so awful squeezes weren’t really on my agenda. I think I’d like to try out Pip one day when in a better mood. Alex had said he would take Georgia down Lanc and Jarvist planned to sneak Una away to Wretched Rabbit, leaving the rest of us to fight over Cow and Pip. Jennifer and Dr Jack were to do Pip. Mr Jack and I decided we certainly were not doing Pip, and both wanted to do Cow. This would have left the trips quite unbalanced, so I said I’d go somewhere else. I also realised that Alex was currently going to be going down Lanc with just Georgia which would make it very difficult to assist with her SRT. A trip down Lanc it was then! 

After a cheeky SRT 101 session on the back of the minibus, we left nice and late – maybe 12 or 1pm. The gods were surely pleased. We had to wait a little bit at the surface of Lanc, naturally, as there were some other cavers on their way down. No complaints though, it was a lovely day and the area is very beautiful. Alex was to rig, and I was to help Georgia on the rebelays, which she had never done before. She was much better than I expected – didn’t rig her descender wrong once and was generally pretty competent. She did get a bit caught up at the first rebelay because she was on the wrong side of the loop, but she was able to get out of the situation with a bit of guidance. It’s nice that the rebelays are so close to the top of Lanc so you can just help from the surface, peering down the concrete tube whilst basking in the sun. 
We were soon in the chamber below, ready to explore Wilf Taylor’s passage. We clambered down to Bridge Hall and left our tackle sack of rope there – it was to rig the pitch in The Graveyard if we had time later. *Disclaimer – I often remember things in the wrong order so the passages described may be a bit muddled. We set off and there was some walking passage before a scary mud climb above a big hole. Luckily there were some nice steps dug into the mud, so it was actually very easy, if a little terrifying. Caving with Alex is nice because he too hates the large holes. At the top of this was a short ladder into an awkward squeeze which took me a little while to get through. There was a lot of thrutching and squeaking, with added expletives for good measure. 

At some point we were walking along some passage when Georgia suddenly fell down a human sized slit in the floor. She just stepped into empty space and dropped. Luckily, she caught herself – I think on her arms and one knee – so didn’t fall down to the bottom (phew). She was a little shocked but seemed fine considering. At another arbitrary point we made a wrong turn and I ended up in a flat-out crawl for quite some time. We decided this wasn’t right but turning around wasn’t possible so there was some awkward backward crawling and then swift removal of thermals (by me) due to excessive heat. 
There were some fun free climbs that I’m glad we didn’t have to climb back up. At one point we came to a junction and decided to go left with Alex in the lead. I heard a “holy shit” from Alex and other phrases such as “that’s terrifying”. I was mildly nervous when turning the corner – was there some horrible cave creature? A giant hole to fall down? It took a while to see, but there was actually a rather large toad chilling on a stal/pointy bit of rock, extremely well camouflaged. Alex had apparently almost used it as a hand hold. 

We made our way down to the main streamway and at the sump found ourselves in the company of four frogs at different levels of starvation/hypothermia. Poor bastards. There was also a terrifying amount of foam on the ceiling, suggesting this area had flooded very recently. 

Some more cave occurred, and we ended up at the bottom of Cow. Did a cheeky bit of SRT to get up to a higher level and Rhys, Mr Jack and Arun appeared. We posed for some pictures and decided to go to The Graveyard as a group. We had rope to rig the small pitch but it was pre-rigged with some fine looking in-situ rope. The Graveyard was cool – covered in stals that vaguely resembled tomb stones. More photography happened before we headed out of the same entrances we came in. 

Nothing too terrifying occurred on the way up. Georgia took a while at one of the rebelays but she sorted herself out. I did end up descending back down to the first rebelay to see if I could see what the problem was (I couldn’t really so just hung there for moral support). I was then too lazy to change over so just did an odd free climb whilst pulling the slack through my descender. It was probably fine. 

We got back to the hut at a reasonable time to find double J had also been to Bull Pot of the Witches because they are speedy af. Dave apparently gets to have two caves because of his second visit with them. Hmm.

### Cow Pot: {{DATE=2018-04-28; CAVE=Cow Pot;}}
### Bull Pot of the Witches: A New Dave: {{DATE=2018-04-28; CAVE=Bull Pot of the Witches;}}

I suppose that I ought to write a report for this or else have it forever lost to the annals of time.

So, due to an unfortunate climbing incident some time ago - combined with a stubborn unwillingness to not go caving in Sardinia (strange from me, I know!) my ankle was properly buggered for this weekend. Nevertheless - I refused to go on two caving weekends in a row with no caving so on Friday I came up with a plan for a sneaky jaunt down BPotW while everyone else was out gallivanting in their 'walking passage'. Sod walking - if I don't leave the rope I don't need to use my ankle! _Dave 1 : Life 0._

I was informed that it's handy to have a handline down the the Chimney entrance - particularly if you're having trouble with, oh I don't know, standing up. So I stuffed the 3 pitch ropes mostly into 1 tackle sack and strapped an arbitrary length handline rope to the outside. Then I hung around for a few hours waiting for the last stragglers to head off to Easegill before setting off on the arduous 200m trek to BPotW myself - on which I definitely did not twist my angle 3 times and shout expletives at no-one in particular.

One entirely auspicious hike later I found myself at the handline bolt. I backed it up to a large nearby tree and strapped on my descender because why not? I carefully descended to the most dangerous looking section of the path at which point the rope ran out. Oh well, fat lot of good that was.

The rest of the trip was fairly uneventful. I played around with getting my knots 'just so' and only left the rope at the top of a pitch once, which it was _totally_ safe to free climb back up. Didn't get wet, got a little bit muddy, down to the bottom in about 90 minutes followed by a quick snack. Solo caving is rather fantastic, you get to go at the Goldilocks pace. My ankle was no worse for wear and another hour later I was back on the surface.

I had a quick pint in the sun before Jennifer & Dr. Jack appeared on the path chatting to some walkers. It seems that in their extreme competence they'd accidentally done Pippikin really fast and were hoping to catch me in BPotW. Alas I'd only left the incredibly useful handline in situ (and whatever various bits of rigging had been left in place by some divers). But hey ho, the rope is already picked out after all...

### Bull Pot of the Witches: The Witches Strike Back: {{DATE=2018-04-28; CAVE=Bull Pot of the Witches}}

... so why not go back? Okay so I might be wearing my surface attire, but since when did that stop anyone? And my clothes were instructing me to Brave the Cave.

We unpacked and repacked the rope into two tackle sacks this time with the plan for Dr. Jack to supervise Jennifer on her first rigging trip. I let them lead on into the top of the Chimney entrance before realising that I hadn't brought a light - so, sensibly, I just stumbled through the entrance puddle blindly towards the top of the pitch.

Jennifer rigged the pitch competently whilst Jack and I discussed how I was _totally willing_ to drive the Tarts to the Ingleborough Cave trail tomorrow, but also sort of couldn't be arsed. (All of which discussion turned out to be completely irrelevant.)

I poked my head down the pitch once the others had descended and wisely decided that it might be challenging without any SRT gear - but I was out of sight of daylight, so I claimed cave #2.

Back at the hut I spent a few hours chopping veg and grating cheese and umming and ahhing about whether to start cooking which I ultimately decided not to do.

Pretty chill night with the exception of some loud wood chopping using the farm's handy-dandy wood-chopping-thing.

## Sunday

### Cape Kennedy: {{DATE=2018-04-29; CAVE=Lancaster Hole;}}
### Bull Pot of the Witches: Return of the Dave: {{DATE=2018-04-29; CAVE=Bull Pot of the Witches;}}
Feeling in the mood for a bit of rigging, I was to take Una, DKP and Arun down BPOTW. Arun rigged the chimney route and I rigged the direct (read: hang off tree) route. It was generally good fun and I didn’t really require any rigging help except for a bit of advice on looseness of traverse lines and help connecting two slings with that knot that I always forget the name of. 

On the way down Una gets a bit tangled at the second rebelay and ends up doing some interesting things to get out of the situation. She then descends, pulling her hair out of her descender several times as though this is normal. So nonchalant. 

None of the rigging was scary which was nice and there was a fun swingy deviation that lead to much amusement. We had a bit of an explore at the bottom but got vaguely bored and decided to head out. My toffee crisp had somehow opened and was a bit wet and grim, so Dave gave me a double decker. Definitely an upgrade (double decker > toffee crisp > crazy caramels). 

Arun de-rigged and we were out in the daylight in what felt like no time. Una found a newt, as one does, and we spent some time chilling at the bottom of the first pitch. I then ascended, deciding my short cows tail was far too short (I seemed to be struggling on ascending rebelays) so will need to adjust. Una was next and gave me a mild fright when she got to the top and just unclipped everything, sitting on the edge of the pitch. It was fine but gosh. 

Good weekend! Bull Pot Farm is well situated but a bit odd. Nowhere quite beats the NPC.

Oh good, someone already wrote today's BPotW trip - which I was of course on. I did scarper rather sooner than the others though, kindly offering to derig the Chimney route and then basking in sunshine for an hour or so.
