Welcome to the continuing escapades of one boy and his Jammer in Slovenia, as he desperately tries to stay alive while following Fratnik up a mountain, while discovering some cave entrances for the next ICCC expedition!

**06-Oct** Arrived just in time for a quick shop, then on for Pizza & a
visit to the Fratniks. This turned into, as it always does, a bout of
high speed tea drinking, playing with the machines in the Barracks & a
quick Sadni Cha at a Cafe. Mercedes is running for town Mayor - election
day is the 24th.

Fratnik turned up the next morning at 8am, bringing an electrician, then
off for a bout of assisting Andrej in inspecting boilers along the way
to Bovec. A quick dash back for caving kit, and on to Dante Jama to
assist some PhD biologists in setting up traps for microscopic shrimp
that live in between the cracks in the limestone. The equipment was
enormous - buckets & funnels designed more for capturing dragons than
bugs...

Another few coffees, and getting the 'business' card of a Brit at the
Slov Karst institute who was looking into the ancient history of the
area, and a loved a bit of caving. Then on to feed the goats, and kill
the fast maturing ram followed by an anatomy lesson in Fratnik's garage
as he was skinned.

On **Friday** I wandered up the start of the peak that becomes the Kalu
col (heading towards Grusnica). No cave potential - dolomite! The path
disappears, or rather fractures into hundreds of sort-of-paths, on which
one stumbles into, or rather, stumbles down all kinds of exciting
cliffs. Having only set off at 3pm (alpine start!), the sun started
setting and I found myself running off the mountain to avoid having to
spend a night in the tick forest. Startled three tasty-looking deer in
one of the many dried up streams, they stood there barely 50m away
looking straight at me as I waved back. If only I had a rifle...

On **Saturday** there was a proper morning start, alarm at 5:30 to jump
in Andrej's car and drive round to Bovec. We were hunting shamwar
through an improbably steep forest, where Andrej had last been 20 years
ago with his father. I managed to scare away the only couple that we
saw, so we entertained ourselves by trying to find an alternative path
down to the valley from 1500m. Andrej had 20m of 6mm rope, which he was
eager to attempt to abseil down, but most ways were too risky even for
him. On our way back, we found a machine gun emplacement from the very
end of the first world war, probably never used. It went to a slit cut
into a cliff-face, from which the entire valley could be covered. Its
probably not going to be there much longer - an enormous crack runs
across the passage, the entire front of the cliff is leaning out... Many
many caves in the area (see the illustrated photos of a random peak),
none of which have been looked at by any caving clubs... However, due to
the incredible steepness of the valley, its probably a matter of
attaining the summit (easy from Bovec) and then abseiling down to the
entrances, possibly with the help of a camp in the valley directing
proceedings by radio.

**Sunday** was my day off. Woke up at 8, read a little, slept again,
woke up and made coffee etc. Then Andrej turned up at 1 in a slightly
less cheery that usual - some Slovene cavers down Poloska should have
been out at Midnight, and were approaching their rescue callout. Went
down to the goats and helped Andrea & Andrej shear three of them. By
three O'Clock, Andrej had received a call from someone that went to the
cave entrance to check the logbook & found no sign of the cavers - now
underground for 25hrs & so made the fateful call. Briefly back in Tolmin
to grab kit, Andrea went to look after the machines in the factory while
we shot round to Polog. Sprinted up the hill to the valley entrance with
the intention of leading a two man mission; as the other cave rescue
could not be there before seven. However, Andrej was the only one of the
available rescuers who knew the cave, and so was deemed too important to
send in short-handed. We waited for an hour and a bit, and directed two
alpine rescuers towards the correct cave entrance. They then radioed in
the HELICOPTER bring the cavers! We were expecting it to land on a
meadow down in the valley, leaving them to trudge up the 200-300m ascent
to the entrance, but oh no! After a few flybys at various heights (its a
very strange experience to have a helicopter fly below you through a
valley), it swung around and pointed straight towards the entrance.
Hovering barely a foot above the &gt;45 degree scree slope, with the
rotors just skimming the rock in front, seven cavers and a dozen
tacklebags tumbled out onto the mountain.

After a protracted faff, we finally set off UP Poloska in the twilight
at 7pm. It is a lovely cave, but preferable (mainly due to the vertical
squeezes) to enjoy from above! Trudge, scramble, crawl... etc. All kinds
of places to get lost, but Andrej found the way as usual. One of the
slovenes had been through Poloska a few times, so Andrej was pretty
certain they wouldn't have got lost - and was instead thinking of the
logistics of stretching a casuality out the various parts of the cave.
The 15m supposed 'freeclimb' is rather exciting; easy and with good
handholds but entirely exposed. I would rather not. From the bottom
entrance it went down through, so we chucked Andrej's 8mm rope down &
abseiled, self-lining with a croll on the way back.

Now just before the nasty vertical squeeze, it was gone midnight with
most of the cave covered and no sign of the missing Slovene cavers. Most
of the rescuers stopped here, setting up a stove & brewing some coffee.
If the cavers were injured beyond here; Andrej suspected at least a week
long rescue & probably some rock-reshaping, due to the squeezes on
either side they were between. Andrej, myself, and two climbers went on.
The vertical squeeze was a nasty thing to climb, too tight with friable
rock. One of the housebrick-sized handholds exploded into ice-cube sized
chunks just as I pulled myself level with it; cutting my brow. Poor me.

Beyond was a 10m pitch, climbed impressively easily by one of the Slovs
(he had some cool climbing boots) who dropped a piece of string back
down for us to climb. Dumped kit & flew along the tight rift - suddenly
one of Andrej's 'HEY HO!' was answered. The missing party - found at
2am!

They were camping at the bottom of the entrance pitch series, after
having pulled their rope through and failing to find the way on through
the tiny bit of rift. For future reference, STAY HIGH and note the
bloody great big carbide arrow! It was quite an atrocious failing in
route finding; Andrej put in down to overconfidence (as ever they were
wearing climbing rather than caving harnesses...). A 500m pull-through
doesn't really seem like the best place for novices... The camp was
pretty nice though; no draft, a drip of water in the corner and
perfectly dry. They had slept on a mat of rope under a tent of space
blankets.

So, with no injuries, but not way of getting up the last 150m of
pitches, we turned and slowly drudged down the way we came. I caved out
on Autopilot, napping for a bit on my tacklebag. Finally out at 7am,
with the last few stars glimmering & a beautiful shadow cast across the
valley by the nearly-full moon. Then racing down the scree after Andrej
in the gathering light, down to the alpine hut to marvel at the 3
computers & 8 radio cave-rescue van, and drink Sadni Cha. Passed the
rather-too-late film crew on the road back to Za Tolmin, stopped & saw
Andrej interviewed in front of a picturesque waterfall for 'Slo TV'.
Finally back at home for 9am; some couscous & then to bed.

Unfortunately; no photos of the entire thing - it was a serious trip!
But the alpine rescuers had some digital SLRs trained on the helicopter
unloaded; I'll see if Andrej can get a copy...

**Friday 13th October: First Trip to Kal** Well, it took me over a week
to actually, finally, get up there! Set off at 6am with a 24kg load,
almost all of which was dried food. Foggy and dark; wander out of Tolmin
via the 7000 Italian soldier graveyard was distinctly eerie, only human
shapes being the occasional jogger zipping past me. By the Devil’s
Bridge, I was already ascending above the cloud layer, the mountains
looming directly above while all around was still indistinct.

Trudge, slip, trudge etc.

Path to hydro even more dodgy than last time; gulley-bridges appear to
have all collapsed under the exceptional winter, leaving one to traverse
on a slippery cliff face. Someone appears to be spreading hardcore on
the path & has cleared the forest around the war memorial - so it may
improve quickly! A good few sweet-chestnut trees either side of the
Jelovscek (where the broken-hearted cheese-maker used to live), managed
to grab an easy cargo-pocketful even though out-of-season already.
Cadged a lift up to Ravne once on the road; refilled water & chatted to
an old hunter watching a Chamois stalk high above.

Christ - that hill in BIG and STEEP. Its amazing how nostalgia so
quickly clouds the memory... Path through the woods well maintained as
ever; more scree placed on the higher bits up to the huts - perfect
walking. A single shot rang out from the hunting party on the other side
of the Ravne valley.

The comf-hut on the far left has just built themselves an enormous
limestone balcony - perhaps they’re planning to fly in a picnic table?
Less than impressed by the enormous veruca they’ve made in the
mountainside to quarry the stone from.

A quick look around for the blowing-dwarf pine I fell into, but did not
have GPS to log, during the snow at New Year. No luck - there’s ‘undreds
of possible bushes on that first hillock! One of which was hiding a
t-shirt. Lifted the rotting cloth up, both relieved and disappointed to
discover it wasn’t covering the bones of Andrej’s previous victim.

A lunch of twice-baked bread dipped in olive oil (why on earth do we not
have this in the Bivvi?) and an entertaining time suspending all the
provisions from the ceiling of the hut (to avoid nibbles from the mice).
I was to go see Andrej sing at Javorca church (the 90th anniversary of
its construction), but fell asleep on ‘that bench’ in the still air &
lovely warm sun. Disturbed only by the snorts of Chamois wandering past,
finally awoken by a bird landing on my trouser-leg - I wouldn’t have
expected those little alpine sparrows to be carrion feeders! Woke up
sun-kissed and dehydrated; the UV had turned my bottle of black current
squash transparent - but drank whatever foul chemicals it had progressed
into nonetheless!

Checked time to see that I had just one hour to descend - no chance!
Took the Primadoni path; as the path marked on my map over Grusnica had
clearly been destroyed by the enormous landside in the Tolminka valley.
(NB: There’s a footpath to Cadrg clearly marked on the road up the
Tolminka, about level with Javorca; the path from Kal to Cadgr is meant
to be very good)

All kinds of exciting holes visible from the path - plenty on the West
of Kuk, loads below Kal itself in the Fault-valley (Andrej warns that
it’s an area of Dolomite & breakdown - but who knows?). Lots on the face
of Mig itself, but I assume these have all been looked at... Also a
series of interesting holes in the gulley dropping down below Pl.
Dobrenscica, viewable from foot of gulley (marked on 1:50000 map).

Dropping down into the valley around 5pm; I could hear the church bells
for the end of service. The Tolminka valley itself is very interesting;
the dry-weir near Pl. Na. Prodih being beautiful and surreal!

A plod past Poloska, seeing the walked-on remains of Andrej’s “JAMA
-&gt;” arrow from the rescue last week. By the time I had got to
Javorac, the church bells were silent & no cars were parked near by.
Soon hitched a lift though - from someone who turned out to be a
next-door neighbour of Tet, crawling in the backseat amongst some farm
machinery. No need to buckle up; decapitation upon impact was
guaranteed.

“A short bad drive is better than a good long walk!” All Slovs seem to
have Simon Le Taxi’s outlook!

Managed to buy some more food, and turn on the kettle on, but fell
asleep before managing to either cook or brew. Awoke in the predawn to
the sound of Andrej putting the kettle on...

**Saturday 14th October: Rescue training with JRS/JSPDT**

Eurgh! Strong instant Karma, breakfast of the usual bread, butter &
honey - then flying across Slovenia in Fratnik’s caving wagon. Pulled up
before the film crew arrived, and dropped the 70m surface shaft (two
rebelays on through-bolts, pick a tree initially). Landed rather close
to a very decomposed deer.

Fratnik came down after replacing a too-short rope on the alternative
caver entry, getting a full-on hit on his helmet from a stone tumbling
down - I had just enough time to run from the zone. As soon as he was
there, he took me to see the bones of a non-mainstream partisan from the
second world war - fraternal rivalry. Some prior caver had rather
touchingly constructed a cross out of fallen branches marking the small
collection of bones.

Of course, this being Fratnik, he picked the skull straight up,
remarking on its quality, and noted that it lacked a gunshot wound. It’s
a good thing he can’t juggle, otherwise I’m sure he would have attempted
it then and there. Please God, let him never consider the possibility of
constructing a recorder from a Femur.

The rescue was a posed-for-TV affair; they have four more serious events
a year, where a volunteer is stretcher’d out during a full day from
about minus three-hundred from various caves. This time however, a
squeeze was created in the corner of the enormous chamber for the
stretcher to be filmed being extracted from. Fratnik & myself climbed
20m of flow-stoned boulders to perch ourselves halfway up for one of the
film crew to enjoy as he was lowered down spinning gently.

So - who got to be the casualty? Why; the 70kg non-Slovene speaker!
Strapped to a spine-board, I could wiggle my fingers & scratch my chin
but that was all. Even my helmet was held fast! An excruciating
interview from boot-height and the ascent was started, but not before
one of the cameraman was hauled up to film. Initially horizontal, I was
lowered to vertical after ten metres, as I had no face shield & the
smooth manoeuvre looked good for the cameras below!

It started to get properly scary at this point. Though I was sure they
must exist, I couldn’t remember there being any cross-linking strops
forming a harness, just the Velcro of the orange plastic & the buckles
lashing me tight. My weight was supported by my feet placed in little
braced loops of webbing - I was basically standing in stirrups. As the
weight was off-centre, the stretcher leaned forward slightly. The
feeling was exactly like when you teeter on the brink of something, when
every reflex in your body is telling you to put a foot forwards. Only I
couldn’t move a muscle, I was entirely at the mercy of the random Slov
prussik’ing beside me & was wondering exactly what kind of lunacy rig
was holding me there dangling 60m above the drop.

Things were (as normal) absolutely fine; I came up grinning for the
camera & noted the cool petrol-driven winch & pulley-carriage upon a
tensioned traverse that I’d been lifted to. One moment of horror when I
was disconnected from the hauling rope & started slipping down the steep
leave-greased bowl of the entrance. I really hope I was clipped into
something, but couldn’t turn to see, let alone do anything to halt my
progress. Perhaps it would be better not to find out.

I (and I think to an extent us in general) have considered Fratnik, if
not the typical Slovenian, then at least a representative for the whole
breed of Slovenian cavers. This he is not. Of the rescue training party,
all the other slovs (except for one old-school dude with hundreds of
rescue-society insignias plastered over his helmet) had the normal quota
of cows-tails, and they were all dynamic rope (rather than the
super-static webbing Fratnik prefers). They also rigged the cave not
only with backups for the hangs and used all the available rebelays, but
even had cows-tail traverses to clip into for the climb down into the
doline. Strange indeed!

After the rescue, we all went on to an old mountain-high post office
(now pub), where the prior weeks’ rescue Austrian Alpine Insurance paid
for a slap-up meal, coffees & all but infinite jugs of local wines!
Chatted to the head-dude over food; they have the system well sorted
here. If the rescued have insurance, they claim on it, if not - the
rescue is free. Money from the insurance claims is spent on equipment,
petrol for the rescuers & the occasional meal.

**Sunday 15th October: Most na Soci cave**





Cave is a
*10m climb up above the road to Most na Soci, on the banks of the dammed
Soca. Waterfalls are seen to spout from the mountainside during heavy
rain; we looked at just one of these outlets. Cave is a crawl going in
for*

40m, with various climbs, possible springs & etc. Some spraypaint PSSs &
carbide marks show that we’re not the first. Lots of possible diggable
or expandable leads, though Andrej suggests we come back when some water
is in evidence in order to find out where it comes from. Rock is well
washed, except for occasional dead muddy climb. Clearly some formations
have been stolen (stal & straws).
The underground lake, referred to in a 1920s JSPDT journal is still
therefore missing.
