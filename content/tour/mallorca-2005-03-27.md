Title: Mallorca
Date: 2005-03-27
Location: mallorca
Summary: We're back, and Mallorca was absolutely brilliant! Lovely weather, great villa [minus the pond scum on the pool], fantastic caving, fresh oranges + lemons from the trees in our garden, a day of sailing and sunburning. Clouded over on the last day, but other than that - a strictly t-shirt + shorts affair.

## 27th March - Arrival

0mallorca/2005-03-28%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0750.html) Against all
expectation, everyone managed to make it to Stansted well in time to Check in.
Jarv took about an hour to get through security; they seemed to take offense
at the rather densely packed X-ray of a rucksack stuffed with a few grand of
varying electronics. After unpacking cameras, GPSs, MP3 players, FX3 headsets,
MigLights, Flashunits + toothbrushes, we finally got through.

Jo managed to loose her passport by putting it in her bag for safekeeping, but
still made it to the gate in time. Flight smooth; cloud cover suddenly broke
somewhere near Barcelona, leaving us with a beautiful crossing of the Med. The
jutting limestone headlands of the northern Mallorcan coast looked impressive
from the air.

After the hire-car companies had lost + refound our booking a few times, we
were finally ready to go. Car-Jo took a wonderful little scenic detour via
Alcudia before arriving at our Pollenca villa. After essential Pesto-Pasta was
located in an oversized off-license [Easter Sunday is not a good day for
shopping in Mallorca, unsurprisingly!], we embarked on our first 'caving'
trip.

## 27th March - Church Cave

0-%20mallorca/2005-03-27%20-%20lyndon%20-%20canon%20s50/me_153_5350.html)
Deepster, TackleMeister extraordinaire, managed to pack the uncharged FX3
batteries, resulting in a Tikka-led expedition. Fair application of stunt
driving + navigating, the free tourist roadmap was not really up the job of
locating vague cave entrances - something that would become a hallmark of the
tour. Once there, we found the gate unlocked + open - no requirement to pirate
unfortunately.

0mallorca/2005-03-27%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0726.html) Large stone
staircase led down the enormous shaft, arriving at a flagstoned-floor with a
large cross in the centre, and two shrines built into crevices in the rock.
Areas of cave continue behind these brick facades, plenty of room to squeeze
past. Main shrine offers an easy squeeze to the left down to a large sump.
Small gated section [easily squeezed through] leads past a 'Forbidden' spanish
sign to some cave continuation; much evidence of bat droppings.

## 28th March - Cova de les Rodes [Wet Cave]

After awaking nice and early (9am!) we popped out to the supermarket to get
some breakfast food and BBQ material for dinner. Thanks to a slow breakfast
and sufficient phaffing, we ensured that we weren't underground until mid-
afternoon.

[ ![A photo](/caving/photo_archive/tours/2005%20-%20mallorca/2005-03-28%20-%20jarvist

0mallorca/2005-03-28%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0743.html) The cave for
the day was to be _Cova de les Rodes_, a nice bimbly cave with the promise of
underground swimming in sump pools. The cave is located 300m up the valley
from the seaside resort of Porto Pollenca and is accesible up a track about
200m from the seafront carpark [a straight dirt track with a rusty iron gate
visible ~100m from the road - not the concrete track 50m further towards the
sea!]. To get to the cave, walk around the rusted gate, along the left of the
abandoned stone building, down some flying steps cut into a brick wall, then a
180 degree turn to the right to end up at the natural gulley entrance.

[ ![A photo](/caving/photo_archive/tours/2005%20-%20mallorca/2005-03-28%20-%20jarvist
%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0746--thumb.jpg) ](/caving/photo_archive/tours/2005%20-%2
0mallorca/2005-03-28%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0746.html) The cave was
described as an 'easy walk in cave' but we found the 'easy climbs' more
resembling pitches, with shonky bolts and all. Determined to get further than
the 60m graffiti spoiled entrance chambers, we alpine-butterflied together a
rope ladder and clambered down [3m straight drop onto flowstone from which the
experienced could climb, otherwise 7m total length ladder / rope onto true
floor]. After a few hundred metres of fairly easy passageway, we came to the
pool described in the ICCC 99 trip, but decided to leave the swim until on the
way out, instead clambering through two small muddy windows high up on the
left. Easy stooping passageway brought us to the next climb [4m straight drop,
tied to stal grill, backed to column 2m further up the passageway], duly
passed with another rope ladder.

From the base of the climb, one could enter water from the direction that we
came, or continue along fairly grotty and crawly passageway, which went along
the top of a tight rift along which a fairly energetic stream flowed 5m below
us. Flood debris abounded from this point; the crawl at the foot of the 4m
climb was puddled, the roof only about 1m above the height of the static pool.
Way continued uphill, along several very slippery muddy slopes, around an
enormous 1m diameter column in the centre of the passage and finally arriving
at slippery pitch. Looked to be hand climbable with a safety line; mud
abounded - couple of dodgy bolt holes and plenty of flakes to tie to - but we
were out of equipment and so left it undescended.

Lyndon Leggate

Once derigged as far as the large pool, we entertained the possibility of a
little swim. Suitably persuaded, Lyndon, Jo &amp; El Deepster stripped down to
their swimming costumes, making waves to sink the floating scum. Water was
crystal clear until the sediment was stirred up. Quite without warning, I,
Jarvist, was stripped bare by the horde of lecherous swimmers left only with a
MigLight and waterproof camera to shield what was left of my assualted
modesty.

Once in the cold, cold, water we travelled as far as a short duck. My spirit
already broken, I was slave to the swimmer's murderous whims. Octopus Jo
forced me under the water &amp; through rift. Once convinced I wasn't chocking
on CO2 in the next air bell, she dived under herself &amp; pinned me under the
submarine ledge until I was limp with asphixiation, drifting to the surface
only once Jezebelle-Jo had abandoned her prey in boredom.

Chased by the crack of an FX3 battery belt at my rather exposed posterior, I
scrambed up the far exit of the pond, slicing my exposed knees, but noticing
that we had indeed bypassed the aforementioned 4m climb.

They were just as mean on the way back, but finally - after a few more abusive
photos for future blackmail against me, I was grudgingly allowed my clothes
back. Huddled in the corner of the muddy chamber, I wept bitter tears for the
apalling, nay tortourous way that I had been treated.

Jarvist Frost

...Hmmm, now we all know that Jarv is mentally deluded. Hence the above
account should be recounted by a sane member of the human species: Sandeep,
Lyndon and Jo decided to go for a pleasent swim whilst clad modestly in
stylish swimming gear. However, 2 minutes after entering the water, a crazed
naked-ape like creature plunged after them... Proof of age required for
further information.

Joanna King

Drifted home after a quick trip to the sea; Pesto Pasta - the way forward.

## 29th March - Sailing By

Late start to the day, pleasent breakfast under the sun cooled by a
strengthening sea breeze. Perfect for beach antics.

0mallorca/2005-03-29%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0753.html) Convoy of
two cars headed off towards Port Pollenca, Lyndon in lead with Jo, Deepster +
Gerardo bringing up the rear. Seperated by a roundabout, Lyndon pulled in to
let Jo catch up. As they went past, Sandeep waved like a trooper, reasurring
Lyndon that Jo would know that she had just passed us. We followed as fast as
the traffic would allow, but failed to spot Jo. Half an hour of a wild goose
chase later, we finally met up on the sea front. Sandeep had waved to the
other car without breathing a word to the driver, Jo assuming that his
seemingly random hand flapping was just him elucidating a point. He then
patiently watched Jo drive around like a headless chicken before deciding to
mention that he had seen us... Doh!

We found a place to hire sailboats, and decided on the rather oddly named
'Galeon' 14ft keelboat. It would have been large enough to squeeze all five
expectant sailors, but we split our 3hr 48 Euro session into two groups of
three instead. Tacking back and across the bay in the glorious sunshine,
skidding along with the gunwales awash during the many gusts - far too
pleasent for a caving trip! Disembarking after many hours fighting the
offshore breeze, the Able Seamen drifted home around 6pm; throwing together a
rather disjointed but enjoyable BBQ. While huffing and puffing the charcoal
into life, Jarv caught a rather nasty red hot ember strike into his eye; no
permanent loss of sight though, as exciting as the prospect of wearing an
eyepatch while swilling grog would be.

## 30th March - Sa Compana [Big Cave]

05-03-30%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0770.html) Bring on the SRT! Early
start, left the Villa by 10am and were soon wiggling our way up the fantastic
bends of the C710, then down towards Sa Compana - flying over the beautiful
Scalextric inspired 270 degree bridge bend. Pulled up by 11, we were faffing
with rucksacks when an enormous "Mountain Police" 4x4 roared up, and three men
in oh-so-tight lycra dived out clutching gleaming tacklebags of prepacked kit.
Gerardo applied his language skills, and discovered that these three men in
tights were 3/8 of the entire Cave Rescue Organisation for the Balearic
Islands, doing a light spot of training for the day. They shot up the hill, we
waddled slowly after them; following the many carns up to the ridge, then the
vast quantities of red spray paint around to the entrance.

Catching them up at the entrance, we eyed up each other changing with equal
amusement / bemusement; us with disbelief at their shiny entirely scratch-free
Pretzl metalwork, them at the sight of finest Yorkshire mud that we had
imported into the country. I really wonder whether UK cavers have an entirely
inverted [jaundiced?] view of caving equipment compared to the rest of the
world; we view new + shiny kit with suspicion and an assumption of
inexperience, the continent sees inexpeience in not bothering to keep every
item gleaming and serviced.

05-03-30%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0780.html) Entrance pitch was a
pleasent semi-daylight-lit 10m abseil down a steep slope, into what would be a
very large chamber for the UK. Once everyone was safely down, we wandered
around the corner into the cave itself.

Big doesn't even start to describe it. Enormous formations, stalagmites and
flowstone larger than houses, curtains larger than facades on Oxford Street,
gour pools more at home on Brighton beach. Amazing stuff; we orbited the
little tea-lights showing our path back out the chamber, calling to each other
across the 5s echo and generally exploring the Venusian landscape.

Way on was via a clamber down from the entrance of the cave to the left and
down, arriving at a flat ledge overlooking a step drop. Rigging of one good
bolt backed to a large Stal, with a deviation above the pitch head to avoid
the worst of the rub points, one descends onto a narrow ledge rebeley from a
stal-grill which then widens out before turning into an ever-steeper 60m
flowstone slope. If you traverse to the left [facing up-slope] as you descend,
you can reach a region from where scrambling is possible for all but the least
experienced - however you've got to ensure that the rope stays in location!

The Spanish rescuers-in-training had already occupied all the bolts with their
worryingly tightened hangers, so we chained in our maillons with a spare
hanger and did our best to avoid a cats-cradle. Once in the muddy chamber, we
lit a fair few lights and cracked open our Darren drum of bageuttes; a very
pleasent lunch by candlelight.

Jarvist took over rigging duty, leading a handline along the muddy bolders,
noting the very odd [and quickly cooling] breathing of the cave - 3s in, 2s
hold, 3s out. Army crawling slope leads directly to a ~6m pitch, two bolts on
the right to form a hand-jammer line down to the backup bolt 4m to right of
pitch, which then forms horizontal traverse onto the pitchhead where a bolt
leads from the ceiling. As I descended the pitch with the five others filing
down into the rather constrained area behind me, the Speedy Spaniards met us
coming the other way. Squeezing aside to let them past, about 60minutes was
spent rerigging to our hangers, with a lot of Spanish swapped between them and
our translator Gerardo.

Apparently, the backup bolt which formed the pleasent horizontal traverse
snapped on removing their hanger, resulting in them backing the pitch directly
to the two bolts higher up. Time was getting late and this was Gerardo +
Pella's first SRT trip so we decided to turn around and find our slow way out.
Getting off the new pitch head was exciting to say the least, requiring full
use of go-go-gadget legs, followed by a hard grovel up a muddy slope dragging
sacks.

steady; Jo leading Pella &amp; Gerardo in the first wave while Lyndon + Deep
derigged as Jarv faffed back and forwards in the middle whistling to the
Prussickers, loitering on the rebelay ledge and lighting candles. Sunshine was
glorious as we exited; gobbling Bananas and L's seemingly endless supply of
Jelly sweets before ambling along the 90minute walk back to our cars. We drove
the last couple of Km to the seaside resort, sitting outside for a coffee in
the gathering twilight. While hopping race up the slope to the cars, we bumped
into the Rescuers staying in Sa Compana overnight; managing a stilted
conversation about the size and awe of the cave while pretending not to huff
and puff from our wacky race.

## 31st March - Les Basses [Deep Cave], Terensa [Holey Cave] + NUCC BBQ

  * Late getting up but fairly efficient kit packing. Left villa at Noon ish.
  * Decided to split into two groups. Sandeep, Jarv &amp; I set off for "Avenc del pla de les Basses" - a 130m deep pot not out of place in Yorkshire.
  * Ok; now everyone is complaining about my engineer stylee writing - not enough flower waffle so...

Joanna King

### Penya de Roja

Pella failed her Spanish test today. Looking for "Penya de..." she drove us
into a Military Zone. We tried to escape as soon as possible from the firing
range.

After arriving at "Mirador de la Victoria" we walked for an hour until we
reached a cute hermitage at 280m above sea level, and started looking for the
cave entrance. The view of Alcudia Bay from the entrance of the cave and the
whole walk up and down along made the trip worth the while.

Gerardo Ocana-Fuentes

Points noted by Pella:

  * Do not walk to cave wearing flip flops. You will be scalded by middle aged German women.
  * Lyndon likes tight squeezes. He will lead you into tight wedges - follow with trepidation.

Once inside the cave, great bimbling ensued; the Salle des Ossos [bone
chamber] shirked exploration. A pleasent trip none-the-less.

05-03-31%20-%20jarvist%20-%20canon_a60/IMG_0804.html) The vague instructions
left us unsure where to park on Cap de Formentor, we found a likely spot with
a viewing gallery over a shear cliff. This is not where you want to park;
you're on the wrong side of the headland. We set off exploring down something
in hindsight looking more valley than doline, poking amongst the undergrowth
looking for the 30m pitch of plummiting death. Even without kit, going was
distinctly unfriendly. 600m of Grade II Scrambling later [Flip-flops ill
advised *ahem*], we reared a 5m cliff face scramble. I sat down in the sun at
the top, and left the two mig freshers to clamber the last couple of hundred
metres to the coast.

Ten minutes later, Geriatric Jo came gallumphing back to bring joyous news.

Jarvist Frost

Well, whilst Juvenile Jarvist was jaunting round in his flip-flops, hardcore
cave explorer GI Jo discovered a new and exciting cave. She battled her way up
the "Pooh Mountain" approach and entered the treacherous "Bear Cave". Evidence
of previous unsuccesful attempts were apparet by the mountains of skeletal
remains heaped up at the cave entrance.

cave was full of shit. A shit mountain in fact, warm and scrunchy for
scrambling in flip-flops. Obviously a refuge for wild goats, the floor
consisted of a shag-pile carpet 20cm deep in olive-pit sized + shaped excreta.

Caving off a Red LED key-fob light, we admired the pretty formations,
considered the turd-tastic crawling way on + took a smattering of photos.
Smelt like goats slept in the place; there were a couple of half-burnt candles
stuck to an upturned saucepan. Strange - not exactly the most romantic place
for an evening picnic; half expected to find the remains of a decayed convinct
who had been hiding out here.

was hand-to-hand wrestling with the bear, but as soon as it ripped off my top
and saw my bulging muscles it scappered and I carried GI back to the car. [Ed:
I feel we have had a rather troubling insight into Sandeep's dark fantasies.]

truth... After exploring the little chamber with pleasent formations, we had a
little climb-around with played with the ram's skull. For some reason Jarv
thought it was ok to walk BAREFOOT in the goat droppings. But this is because,
as I have said before, he is completely and utterly stark raving mad. [Ed: If
you ever get the chance, try walking in dried droppings with flip flops - when
barefoot, they glance off like pebbles - trapped between a flip flop and your
foot, the result is far more squidgy] I rescued his flip flop and forced him
to wear it. [Jo says: "The fastest I've ever seen Sandeep move!"]

and with our presence requested at the NUCC BBQ; we decided to give up on Les
Basses and head on towards the very end of the headland, the most NE part of
the Island. We popped in to the lighthouse for a quick view + a turn around,
then pulled up a few hundred meters back up the road. We stripped off as the
couple in the car in front had an argument [Ed: Lie - they were just eating a
late lunch; though they did fold in their mirrors so they wouldn't have to see
us change behind them, Hah ha!]. The looks we got from passing cars ranged
from astonishment to worry. At the cave entrance GI was given her first bit of
rigging practice, though Jarv still tied the bunny-knot for her first Y-hang.

eager to inspect the "really mad rub-point ... the sheath almost all the way
through" of the [1999 ICCC visit](mallorca99.php). The rock was truly a slab
of cheese grater, harsh enough to kneel against with double-skinned neoprene
knee pads. Desperate for a deviation, I slung a sling around some dried mud on
the right wall, and tried to orchestrate a free hang to the bottom. The walls
were covered with crumbly deposits, the stal on the far side that would be
ideal to rig from were a 6m swing away. There were other bolts visible, but
other than the vaselined two at the top, they seemed pretty appaling - visible
by enormous rust stains on the cave wall. Loading up the deviation, one of the
two nodules I had wrapped the sling around came pinging off, richocheting down
the 30m shaft. However, it now appeared to be a straight drop with a slight
rubpoint 4m below the deviation.

If the deviation failed, the rope would be toast - I don't think I've ever
seen rock so abrasive as that first ledge. Therefore, unwilling to risk my own
life, I sent Jo down instead and got her to attach a rope protector at the
slight rub. Sandeep followed, while I loitered at the top ready to repair the
riging. Other than the Deepster kicking the rope protector down the drop [what
a lovely whoosh they make!], it all held well.

hang on the way down was impressive with some cool green deposits and
impressive staligtites. I got to the bottom, and enjoyed a died bar each with
the GI, while Jarv checked pulled up half the rope to check the rub point. Jo
soon headed up carefully with instructions to rerig the protector, while I was
left with a nice warm descender to keep me company. Collecting the protector
and derigging the deviation, exit was smooth &amp; the rope was fine - the rub
point consisted of a smooth limestone flute, nothing to really worry about.

By now it was quite late, so we stomped back to the car, stripped and
reclothed in double-quick time. On the way back along the road, we saw the
clear saucer-like doline depression of Les Basses - how we failed to spot it,
I'll never know. Next time you shall be ours.
