## Saturday

We left Beit at 10am, hoping to reach Yorkshire early enough to do an evening cave. Plans were still underway, right until we drove up to the hut and saw the icy floor and the Brown Hill team (Diss, Jennifer, Cecelia and DKP) who highly advised against
going out. The power also tripped so we had the fire in the dark, and the kitchen was lit with DKP’s helmet lights.

Arun wanted a hair cut and had faith that we could cut it better than his 15 year old sister. Rhys took a razor while I took small scissors, and each of us took half of Arun’s head. We both quickly came to the conclusion that cutting hair was harder than it looked, and had the dubs bruvs join us in our quest. Arun made us swap around halfway to ‘even it out’. By the end of it, it was clear that his sister did a way better job than us, and the only reason why it didn’t look that bad was because Arun had a face that could pull off anything.

## Sunday

## Monday

Jennifer, Solomon and I went down Bar Pot, with Jennifer rigging. The first pitch was a little tight, and especially awkward with a tackle sack, but at least we weren’t going up. We heard a ‘heyo’ from behind, and David appeared after incompetently failing to find Flood Pot. After some faff at rigging the traverse, we got down the second pitch, meeting a group of cavers behind us who had no permit to be there but just saw the cave rigged and decided to go down (very rude). I rigged a short traverse, and met up with the Marilyn team and went on to the main chamber together. 

The main chamber was more magnificent that I remembered, with its vastness and amazement beyond what I can process. We spent awhile wandering around the chamber, and it was nice seeing random small moving lights in the distance from people’s head torches. Jack Hare suggested we crawl around to keep warm while waiting for the Flood and Stream teams, and we wandered to the old railways tracks. Beyond the tracks was a small (but not awfully tight) crawl opening to a small side passage that was tall enough for us to stand and reorientate ourselves before crawling back out. We finally saw the Flood team, and Jennifer, Zaeem and I headed out Flood. I got up the first long pitch with a tricky and wet deviation, and knowing that I would be waiting for awhile, I made myself comfortable, switch off my lights and went to sleep. I got woken up by Zaeem’s voice that went something like “Yes” then “Ahh oh no” then “No wait, it’s okay”. Turns out he was happy that he finally passed the deviation, panicked bit when he swung out, then calmed down when he remembered that that’s normal. Jennifer derigged that pitch, while I derigged the rest, void of any panics or terrible situations. It was a long day and we were all tired.

## Tuesday

Panic in the morning when we ran out of Yorkshire tea, and people disapproved of PG so an emergency run to the shop was made. Weather was looking really grim, and I didn’t want to do a long cave after yesterday’s exhaustion. David, Jacob, Cecilia and I went down Notts 2, leaving the hut at 2pm (so late!). We got changed into our oversuit before leaving, and Jacob didn’t mind because his car was already pretty wrecked (his only request was to not smash the cheesecake). The walk to the cave was thankfully short.

The entrance man shaft was lined with scaffolding poles and ladders. The ladders, although short, moved a lot and I relied more on holding the poles than using the ladders. The water level was higher than the previous time David and Cecilia went, coupled with the rain forecast in the afternoon and Jacob’s conversation with an old man that morning who said ‘Don’t go into Notts’, we paused to have a think. We decided that we’d go on for another 15 minutes but would be good to turn around soon. 

The stream way was beautiful with many pretty things to see, and a nice and cold waist deep pool. We spotted the flood bypass route by the side, and the bottom got quiet. As we were about to turn back, David and Jacob thought it’d be a great idea to swim in waist deep water for the fun of it. Cecelia and I stood by the side, watching and laughing. 

We came back at 5pm (leaving late, coming back early - what a day!) and were treated to a Christmas spread, made even better with chicken instead of turkey. I still don’t like brussels sprouts, but it was interesting seeing Jack cook it with diluted marmite because he ran out of soy sauce. The mulled wine that Arun made was amazing too.

## Wednesday

Jennifer, David, James, Jack Hal, Chris and I headed for rescue training. It was a very early start and I made the mistake by not having a cup of tea and was half asleep for most of the morning. That evening, under Janet’s recommendation, we watched The Lair of the White Worm. It’s one of the weirdest movies I’ve seen, and the best I can describe is that it involves a worm and an evil snake lady. Withnail and I came next, and I only managed about half the movie.

## Thursday

Rhys, Huang Guan and I headed down the Shadow route of Ireby Fell Caverns, while James and Solomon went down Ding Dong, with plans to meet at the bottom. The entrance was very wet and the only deviation was there to stop rope rub and actually just brought you into the water. Rhys decided not to bring his camera bag down because he figured he’d be preoccupied with hypothermia more than anything else. 

The shorter pitches at the bottom were prerigged, allowing us to go faster. We considered waiting for James and Solomon, but it was cold and wet so we decided to go ahead first. The passage was large and pleasant, and ended with a sump. It was odd because instead of a thin diving line, thick ropes with alpine knots were used. Rhys told us of the option to climb up a pitch to do a long and muddy crawl to get to the other side of the sump, but it didn’t sound very worth it or pleasant.

On our way back, neat knots were tied to our rope bag, so we figured James and Solomon came and left. It was unpleasant to prussik up a waterfall, although Huang Guan went up quite fast. I was derigging and struggled to get the sling out of the deviation, when Rhys helpfully pointed out that I could stand on a ledge. I tried my best not to drop the sling and thankfully didn’t! 

Rhys was a very nice moral support as he watched me derigged. This was especially important at the traverse where I clipped my short cows tail into the bolt and the long into a loop which I then derigged. I didn’t realise I was only on one point of contact until Rhys commanded me to put my hand jammer on the rope and my long cows tail in the next alpine knot (you know Rhys is terrified when he tells you what to do). He told me to carefully take out my short cows tail and ‘don’t fall’. Thankfully all went well and we pretended nothing happened. I was exhausted but happy because it was a good trip.

## Friday

Despite careful and advanced planning, plans had to be reworked given the heavy rain the night before. We sat in the bus ready to leave, but slowly one by one left and never came back. Eventually I found everyone huddled in the hut to discuss plans given the possibility of sumping between Notts 2 and Lost Johns. There were too many people on the Centipede route in Lost John’s, so I ‘volunteered’ (of sorts) to join Arun, James and Jacob in Boxhead Pot. I didn’t think much of it and didn’t know what to expect (on hindsight should have at least realised it was in the black book), but I thought it’ll be chill and nice since it’s a replacement for the Lost John’s and Notts 2 connection, which are both very pleasant caves. 

James rigged down the first pitch, which was nicely dry despite the wet cave. He went down but came back up the second pitch because he couldn’t find the next bolts, eventually finding it after Arun read out the description. Jacob decided to turn around at this point (it was 2.30pm) since he had a long drive home. On hindsight we should have reminded him to drop a note to the rest of Imperial, since there was some confusion later on where Jacob’s car was gone but the rest of us weren’t around. 

We descended the last 30m rope, only to realise that we’ve gone too far down and went back up the last pitch to start the extensions. I don’t remember the order than things were in, but I remember long and low wet crawls, a terrifying traverse worse than Edward’s Shortcut in OFD given the small ledge with slippery mud and a larger and deeper hole, and an T-shaped passage that was a little too wide and muddy to baby crawl properly without the deep fear of falling. 

The passage follows a series of three hard, awful and terrifying climbs. The first climb down was muddy with a foot loop that was mildly helpful - I slipped down that when my body didn’t wedge in well, my foot was still in the loop and my hand was pinned between the rope and a rock. The second climb down had a hand line with knots, and follows an awkward slide down with the best step being a loose but wedged rock.

When I thought that the worst was over, the next free climb was horrid. The handline was thick and nice to grip, but didn’t have any knots in. The first part of the climb was a rough slope that had good grip and allowed me to pull myself up. The next bit required moving to the side and continuing the climb, without visible good foot holds. I panicked because I didn’t trust myself to have enough arm strength to pull myself up, and there was a real fear of me dropping and hurting myself because the drop is significant (James reckon the climb was 10m). I ended up wedging myself up all the way and got really tired. I was very tempted to bail halfway when Arun suggested it, but getting down seems more terrifying than continuing up.

After the awful climbs, the passage opens to a large and beautiful Aven with many pretty things. There were many deep holes in the floor and the ‘puddles’ were easily more than waist deep. It didn’t seem possible that we’ll make it to Lost John’s in time, so we poked around and turned back. 

Back to the climbs, the handline on the 10m climb was too thick to rig any part of my descender on, so Arun recommended ‘rigging’ it of sorts using two crabs which worked really well. I struggled a lot up the last two climbs and at some point shouted to Arun ‘I’m stuck’ at a squeeze where some part of my SRT got in the way. I think he chuckled and said nah you’re not stuck, and gave me a foot to push off. 

As I crawled and traversed, I tiredly told myself I’m never coming back here again. But as I prussiked up, the pitches were actually pleasant (except when my arm cramped up and I briefly couldn’t bend it) and I changed that to I’ll probably not come back here in awhile. I think I looked quite shaken given the many hugs people gave me when they saw me (or the mud on my face). It took me a cup of tea, some pea soup, shakshuka and three hours later to recover. Reflecting on this 24 hours later, I think I might go back to Boxhead given its potential to connect into Lost John’s and the pretty things below, which might even make the awful bits worth it.
