I made the decision to come on the Easter Tour to Sardinia in early January, on the back of a Christmas holiday where I hadn't (for once) attended the ICCC winter Tour. I was relishing the prospect of a weewk's caving in a warm and decidedly calcareous landscape. 

After weeks of preparation, I finally stumbled on the Sardinian cataster or register of cave data, which hosted a lot of information about the cave locations, entrance photos and most importantly, freely available high resolution surveys.

I contacted Diss, to work out which caves we had planned to visit and find out from Bobo, our local contact, which unique number identified them on the map. Armed with the different 'numero catastale' of Su Palu, Sos Jocos and others, I went ahead and printed the surveys on the waterproof paper I'd trialled earlier in the year. 

All the documents went into a plastic sleeve holder, which I would keep at all times. With surveys, we had coach tickets, flight boarding passes and papers on the karst of the Supramonte, the carbonate massif of Eastern central Sardinia we would be stationed in.

On the Friday before the trip, nine of us met up in stores at 11.00pm, to finalise the packing of the hold luggage using our electronic scales. All the communal equipment fit tightly in the 60L backpacks we'd brought with us, and with a sense of anticipation, we sat down in stores, waving occasionally at the security guard making his rounds, and waited.

### Saturday 24th March
*Where we fly out to Olbia and find the accomodation in Orosei. A group goes hiking to Monte Tuttavista.*

12.00am, 12.30am.  We left to catch a bus for Victoria Coach Station. In lieu of last years complicated peregrinations, we waved down the 52 bus just around the Royal Albert Hall and boarded. We met Rita at the berth for the A3 coach to Gatwick and waited a little bit more. 

I slept in the coach, gathering a little bit of strength, before we dropped off our luggage at the EasyJet booths. I treated myself to a full English Breakfast and then waited some more. 

The flight was fine, although I couln't see the outside due to my position on the aisle, at wing level and kept myself awake by reading the EasyJet magasine, and learning some more about the culture surrounding Vermouth. 

In Olbia, we exited in a bracingly fresh, clear air, picked up our bags and headed for the car rentals. Starting with the Audi A3 (later referred to as Ezio), we worked out that having only one additional driver would be by far a cheaper option than two (an additional 250 EUR - almost the cost of another car!), so I picked up the car, some four poor souls and a few bags, before driving to the nearest big supermarket with Arun, Yan Jin, Ben and Jack.

Loaded with food of all kinds, we received a message from the other team stating that due to a case of smaller-than-advertised-boot, they were heading straight to Orosei, our final destination to drop-off the bags. We stopped shopping at that, paid and left them instructions to find cheap wine. 

There was a short drive to Orosei, using the dual carriageway all the way to Siniscola, and leaving for the SP25, a seaside road, which we drove on for 35minutes before the reveal of Orosei, a cluster of white-walled, red-roofed houses nested at the foot of Monte Tuttevista, a lonely triangular mountain. In the distance, we could see the brooding mass of the Supramonte, and the wide gulf of Orosei.

Taking the small roads in the centre of town, and going wrong only once, we found the accomodation. Three stories, massive white walls, cool air inside, a view of the sea, a couple of kilometres away. This was perfect.

Team Shay, who were in the Jeep Renegade left to stock up on wine. I peered at the mountain above us, thinking hard. It was only 2.00pm, five hours to sunset, and what better to start off the expedition than a cheeky walk up the mountain to take in the scenery?

I recruited Ben, Jack and Yan Jin on this endeavour and packed the essentials; chocolate, peanuts and raisins our sustenance. We then drove to the foot of Tuttevista, parking near a clump of cypresses on the side of the road (our first attempt at finding the start of the path was thwarted by a quarry fence).

We started the ascent in the trees, with a cliff on our left rising above us: it was pockmarked with alcoves and possibly, cave entrances. At a dry well, we turned right towards the 'Belvedere' or panorama, a way which was cairned fairly consistently all the way up. Soon we reached mortared steps into the limestone wall, wounding farther up, to the foot of a rickety wooden ladder. 

At the top, we were treated to better views of Orosei and the sea to the east, and the granite hills to the north. Still following the cairns, we made a slow ascent until we started rounding a false summit. We had reached the 400m contour, with another 400m of elevation to go, and it was getting chilly and windy. We took a few photos and backed down the way we came, satisfied with the unobstructed panoramas we had seen. 

We also heard the bells of impressively large mountain goat herds nearby and left the path momentarily to try to catch a glimpse, buy they were very good at hiding yet sounding close.

We came back to the house to find dinner nearly done, an invigorating feast of spaghetti. Diss also notified us that Bobo wanted to meet us on the morrow, and we decided to arrange a time in the evening to see him in Nuoro. Our address: the appropriate Imperio Bar.

### Sunday 25th March
*Where all of us go caving to Sos Jocos, near Dorgali, then meet Bobo in Nuoro for a beer at the Imperio Bar.*

A good night's sleep saw to a renewed enthusiasm for caving on Sunday. We settled on Sos Jocos, the closest, easiest cave we had a survey for and made sandwiches. After a breakfast of al-dente porridge and bread, we set off towards Dorgali.

The weather was clearing up after a damp start, and there were puddles left over on the winding road to the cave entrance. Peter had a pin on his phone exactly where the entrance should be, and after a while called Team Shay over the radio. 'You've gone too far' he said, 'When are you planning to turn around?'. After a seven point turn, we, team Ezio led the way back to a parking spot, which had deep pools of water all over. 

We got changed quickly enough, having spotted a gate where we hoped to cross into the shrubs and start navigating towards the entrance. We forgot the surveys at first, but Diss went back. I turned the GPS on and started the short 300m walk to the cave. 

The grass had been flattened before our feet, so with relative ease I made my way to a low, inviting archway. I found the metal plaque with the 'numero catastale' and declared the entrance found. Shortly after we'd all congregated by this spot, and taken a group photo we entered. 

There were many bats right after the entrance gate, which had been left open, and straightaway we felt the warmer than usual temperature inside the cave. From the entrance chamber I led the way down towards the right, down a few free-climbable drops, until we were faced with a deep 5m pit. This could not be it surely?

I looked at the survey trying hard to make sense of the maze of passages, hoping wildly that we hadn't reached the end of the cave yet. We had some rope and slings admittedly, but I was keen to find another way. We turned around and saw other lights ahead: Italian cavers. They were not wearing oversuits.

I was guetting suspicious that it was perhaps not a worthwile cave.  Bypassing the Italians, we started along another gallery until we bumped into another group at the top of a short downclimb. We followed, seeing a larger space ahead, with a flowstone formation on the right. There were traces of muddy hands on the calcite: sacrilegious! 

We carried on, to another downclimb over a pristine pool of water we identified as the Lago. There, the tourist cavers hadn't gone, fearful no doubt of filling their shoes with water, and it was our chance to go ahead undisturbed. I slipped down, landing on the squidgy mud floor. The water level was millimetres below the top of my boot. Carefully I traversed around, but not carefully enough: there was a sucking sound, and a cold trickle of water down my foot and I knew I would have to answer to Dave about a certain promise about 'dry caving'. 

Further on there were two ways: a further traverse across the pool and a climb up, or the upstream passage which looked like a sinuous , dry abandonned stream passage. Not far upstream I entered a larger chamber which had large stals in the roof, all of them aligned on a fault plane. My spirits lifted although I couldn't quite make where we were within the cave. 

Further up that sinuous passage were more formations, including large weird radish like black stalactites. Jack almost got freaked out by what turned out to be fungus looking suspiciously like troll hair, but got a grip and moved on. We reached a bend with double pots, and a traverse continuation, more pretties (a profusion of helictites in particular).

Ben led the way into a large room with a massive column in the centre. Everyone whooped at that, turned around and whooped some more: Sala Cleopatra was a cluster of lopsided stalagmites which we took time to photograph. 

When we moved on, I spotted a likely chattiere and sent Jack and Ben in front, hoping it would not lead to a horrible crawl. It turned out to be a small hole in the wall, connecting two large chambers. This one was a massive crossroads some 15m in diameter. Amidst the fallen boulders were broken roof flowstones, exhibiting a strong banding. I'd never seen such clear cross-sections! 

According to the survey, we then visited the Galeria di Ziclopi. There were more climbs and drops over large boulders, but most amazing was a dried out gour pool which almost completely barred an offshoot passage. Climbing over the top, we accessed a bizarre, well decorated passage that clearly had had stalactites growing before filling up due to the gour pool emplacement. The walls and formations were covered in calcite prisms we usually see in growing in water. No the gour pool was empty, and more stalactites grew, lacking the calcite overgrowths. very interesting!

Turning around, we then made our way to the Ramo della Cascata, which had 'basalto' written in many places along the way. Could it be basalt in a cave? I was eager to find out.

In keeping with the rest of the cave, we climbed up and down many times before having to squeeze along the side of a massive calcite ship, which stood towering over us, at the edge of a large chamber.  We stared incredulously at the formation: it was big, absurdly shaped and glittery white. This cave only got better and better!

The very end was a slight disappointment: lots of mud and a black boulder choke. Black? I had a proper look at the boulders and spotted the basalt: eroded in angular boulders, held together by the red mud. Its distinguishing features were the sparse white plagioclase crystals and abundant vesicles. 

We turned around after more photography, content that we'd all had the opportunity to stretch our muscles and get into our caving mojo. At the major cross-roads, I looked up the survey for a shortcut to the way out and quickly found a chattiere that took us to the first lake. 

Everyone got their wellies wet again, but being second to last, I spotted the muddy stump of a stalagmite across the puddle: the perfect handhold for dynamic move across the water and up the slope. I jumped across, foot grazing the water and held on. Success! Behind me I heard a splash: Arun looking disappointed was slowly sinking in the puddle. 


Out of the cave, we decided to have lunch - it was 6.00pm -  before heading to Nuoro to meet Bobo. Team Shay left, but not before I cheekily off-loaded Simon to them. We followed signs to Nuoro, without really asking ourselves any questions. 

At some point en-route, we received a message that one of the bridges on the SP 46 was closed. It was a good thing we were not on that road, so shrugging we carried on, taking in the Supramonte scenery with the setting sun. It was a festival of beautiful colours. 

Then Team Shay shared their location: 30 minutes behind us. How that had happened, I could not know, but we carried on to Nuoro, parked outside the hospital and went inside the Imperio Bar. 

We glanced around briefly, I moved from room to room without spotting anything properly caver like, entered a corridor that led to a door: the toilet, a cul-de-sac. I took advantage of this, but there was no key, so Peter entered behind me. Awks.

Arun then said he'd found Bobo, so we greeted him and Salvatore, and Michaele. They ordered non-filtered Sardinian beer, which was very nice of them and we started talking cave. 

I say talking, more like google translating, and stringing a few Italian words I knew together. But it worked, and by the time the other team made it to Nuoro - after having done some awful off-roading - we had a plan for the next day. We would do a 100m shaft with a knot pass 65m of the way down. Charming. 

I reassured everyone that we would go over the knot pass in the house - we didn't. With the evening drawing late, we found a late night pizza place open in Nuoro, which served some good fare. I had the 'Completa' which obviously had all the meat I craved. 

We put the left-over wine in plastic bottles for later, but not before asking permission from our hosts who were slightly perplexed at this. With dinner over, we drove back to Orosei for a late night at the house. In fact, some stayed awake and ran to the beach for sunrise the next morning.

### Monday 26th March
*Where we meet Bobo near Su Gologone, before caving in Voragine di Tiscali, alongside some Andalucian cavers.*

Too much wine. Not for me personally, though I suffered from a lack of sleep due to the night's antics, but for those damned souls who finished 5L of Vino Rosso during the evening. 

Rita elected to stay at the house for the day, while the rest of us packed the cars with kits for this first SRT cave. We had planned to meet with Bobo at 10.00am near Su Gologone resurgence, at the very foot of the Supramonte. 

We were slowed down by two herds of sheep on the road to our meeting point, and blissfully engaged the cars on a single lane road wending south to Su Gologone, avoiding the closed bridge. The road was absolutely perfect until it cave to crossing the river. There was first a ford to reach a small island in the middle of the stream, which was fine, just fine, and then a narrow, curvy granite bridge. When I got midway, I lost sight of everything but blue sky ahead, and praying that the bottom wouldn't scrape went forwards. The nose of the car dived, and we were through!

We arrived at the meeting place near enough to 10.00am to make no difference, thinking the other group were 10 mins behind. This turned out to be 1 minute only, and since Bobo was there already, we wasted no time in setting off on the Lanaitu valley road. 

I say road. It quickly deteriorated to a dirt track, then there were cobble, and then mostly holes and puddles. But around us, limestone cliffs rose, parted in the centre by the flat bottomed valley we were driving across. 

After some time, we arrived at a shady parking place and started getting changed. Not long after, another convoy arrived and parked next to us. Cavers.  Also bound for Voragine di Tiscali, our cave for the day it transpired. Spanish. 

We set off slightly before them, and Bobo noticed that Jack had not brought hiking shoes (somehow the 30min walk to the entrance had been omitted in our discussions about the cave). His wearing flip-flops led to Bobo grabbing a handful of rocks and miming throwing them at Jack's feet. 'You cannot exist, it's not possible' he said. We all laughed heartily. Jack looked nervous.

After the climb on the rutted road, we reached a small pavement on the side, a vantage point from which we could see the mouth of the cave: it was pretty big. 

Bobo gave me the 'armour bag', filled with bolts, hangers and krabs and ascertained I'd been on expedition before. When he was satisfied, he gave me the metal and led me to the start of the abseil route, putting a short handline on the way down. 

He traversed around an exposed ledge, cowstails in his mouth, with a lenght of dynamic rope attached to a very small tree. He looped the cowstails around a pillar of rock, attached the rope and pointed at it. 'Don't put your weight on it' he said. Reassuring . 

I followed to the first 'Y'-hang and, armed with spanner, rigging gear and vast amounts of rope, started the descent. 'Don't use the red bolts' Bobo said before I went down. Ah, those would be the ones where the rock had shattered around them.

Dave followed to provide morale support. Then the Spaniards caught up, spidering their way across our rigging to find their rebelay route. Why couldn't I have the rebelays like every other human being? 

I reached the final 'Y'-hang above the supposedly 100m hang and proceeded to rig it. It was very fun, seeing the way down to the bottom. I clipped my short cowstails in the wrong loop of rope though (where the ropes had been threaded together) and it took some acrobatics to get it free. At the same time, the Spaniard started a conversation with me. Apparently they had been to Sima Cabra and knew Jose Ballesteros. I eagerly started talking about the merits of the two caves (deep open shafts both), but then remembered that the overly exposed rebelay was perhaps not the best place to have that chat. 

I tested my descender and plunged into the abyss. I kept expecting the knot pass to pop out of my tacklesack at every turn, but it never came. My feet touched solid floor, a good 65m below the rebelay, and out came the knot. That was lucky!

I relayed the message up to Dave, and looked around. It was truly a cavernous place, with a massive flowstone covering the eastwall all the way down. The passage leading off in either direction from the base of the pitch was a good 30 to 40 metres tall, and 10 metres wide. 

At one end, the Grande Frana (Big Fault) passager led off into the heart of the mountain. At the other, a Cwm Dwr -esque crawl led off to a rabbit warren of chambers with nice decorations. 

One by one, Dave, Peter, Ben, Jack, Jennifer, Yan Jin, Arun and Diss came down. Bobo met us at the bottom with a sweet brioche bun which was very much appreciated. Apparently, the lower exit was a mere 3 minutes away from the base of the pitch. Dave and Ben made a swift exit to the cars, so Dave could have a nap and Ben could retrieve his drone. 

At this point, I took a few long exposure photographs and exited via the lower entrance into the sunlight. Plan was to go back up and derig from the top. Down the path, I saw Ben playing around with the drone, having tremendous fun by the  looks of it. At the cars, Dave loaded me with a blue tacklesack he had stolen from the Spaniards at the top of the pitch. Thanks Dave!

I walked back up to the limestone pavement and struck up another conversation with the Spanish. After some convoluted krab exchange, I navigated to the top of the Y-Hang and called out below. Speaking slowly, I alerted them to the fact I was going to take the rope up. The additional 35m of unused rope at the bottom were untied from my rope, which was very nice. However Bobo was adamant he needed the tackle sack more than I. Why, Bobo, why?   

I pulled the ropes up, a tedious job and bundled them up at the top, with the help of the Spaniards. Then, as we were walking down to the cars, the Sun sinking fast to the west, I managed to recall as smattering of Spanish, and understood that the Su Gologone Resurgence was worth a look, as it took the water from most of the karst systems of the Supramonte. 

Team Shay departed earlier as usual, with instructions for a dinner of risotto. In the meantime, Bobo led us, Peter, Yan Jin Ben and I to the resurgence, which was well in flood: the concrete bank along which some locals collect 'pure karstic' water was completely underwater. We could see the force with which that amount of water was propulsed some 40m to the surface: it was a proper Vauclusian spring, with the decor of an 18th century painting.

At the house, it was time to enjoy a well-deserved courgette and mushroom risotto. The nearly 1.5L of wine came through very nicely, and everybody got to bed early, relishing the prospect of the next day's cave, the meat of the trip: Su Palu.
