I made the decision to come on the Easter Tour to Sardinia in early January, on the back of a Christmas holiday where I hadn't (for once) attended the ICCC winter Tour. I was relishing the prospect of a weewk's caving in a warm and decidedly calcareous landscape. 

After weeks of preparation, I finally stumbled on the Sardinian cataster or register of cave data, which hosted a lot of information about the cave locations, entrance photos and most importantly, freely available high resolution surveys.

I contacted Diss, to work out which caves we had planned to visit and find out from Bobo, our local contact, which unique number identified them on the map. Armed with the different 'numero catastale' of Su Palu, Sos Jocos and others, I went ahead and printed the surveys on the waterproof paper I'd trialled earlier in the year. 

All the documents went into a plastic sleeve holder, which I would keep at all times. With surveys, we had coach tickets, flight boarding passes and papers on the karst of the Supramonte, the carbonate massif of Eastern central Sardinia we would be stationed in.

On the Friday before the trip, nine of us met up in stores at 11.00pm, to finalise the packing of the hold luggage using our electronic scales. All the communal equipment fit tightly in the 60L backpacks we'd brought with us, and with a sense of anticipation, we sat down in stores, waving occasionally at the security guard making his rounds, and waited.

*Where we fly out to Olbia and find the accomodation in Orosei. A group goes hiking to Monte Tuttavista.*

12.00am, 12.30am.  We left to catch a bus for Victoria Coach Station. In lieu of last years complicated peregrinations, we waved down the 52 bus just around the Royal Albert Hall and boarded. We met Rita at the berth for the A3 coach to Gatwick and waited a little bit more. 

I slept in the coach, gathering a little bit of strength, before we dropped off our luggage at the EasyJet booths. I treated myself to a full English Breakfast and then waited some more. 

The flight was fine, although I couln't see the outside due to my position on the aisle, at wing level and kept myself awake by reading the EasyJet magasine, and learning some more about the culture surrounding Vermouth. 

In Olbia, we exited in a bracingly fresh, clear air, picked up our bags and headed for the car rentals. Starting with the Audi A3 (later referred to as Ezio), we worked out that having only one additional driver would be by far a cheaper option than two (an additional 250 EUR - almost the cost of another car!), so I picked up the car, some four poor souls and a few bags, before driving to the nearest big supermarket with Arun, Yan Jin, Ben and Jack.

Loaded with food of all kinds, we received a message from the other team stating that due to a case of smaller-than-advertised-boot, they were heading straight to Orosei, our final destination to drop-off the bags. We stopped shopping at that, paid and left them instructions to find cheap wine. 

There was a short drive to Orosei, using the dual carriageway all the way to Siniscola, and leaving for the SP25, a seaside road, which we drove on for 35minutes before the reveal of Orosei, a cluster of white-walled, red-roofed houses nested at the foot of Monte Tuttevista, a lonely triangular mountain. In the distance, we could see the brooding mass of the Supramonte, and the wide gulf of Orosei.

Taking the small roads in the centre of town, and going wrong only once, we found the accomodation. Three stories, massive white walls, cool air inside, a view of the sea, a couple of kilometres away. This was perfect.

Team Shay, who were in the Jeep Renegade left to stock up on wine. I peered at the mountain above us, thinking hard. It was only 2.00pm, five hours to sunset, and what better to start off the expedition than a cheeky walk up the mountain to take in the scenery?

I recruited Ben, Jack and Yan Jin on this endeavour and packed the essentials; chocolate, peanuts and raisins our sustenance. We then drove to the foot of Tuttevista, parking near a clump of cypresses on the side of the road (our first attempt at finding the start of the path was thwarted by a quarry fence).

We started the ascent in the trees, with a cliff on our left rising above us: it was pockmarked with alcoves and possibly, cave entrances. At a dry well, we turned right towards the 'Belvedere' or panorama, a way which was cairned fairly consistently all the way up. Soon we reached mortared steps into the limestone wall, wounding farther up, to the foot of a rickety wooden ladder. 

At the top, we were treated to better views of Orosei and the sea to the east, and the granite hills to the north. Still following the cairns, we made a slow ascent until we started rounding a false summit. We had reached the 400m contour, with another 400m of elevation to go, and it was getting chilly and windy. We took a few photos and backed down the way we came, satisfied with the unobstructed panoramas we had seen. 

We also heard the bells of impressively large mountain goat herds nearby and left the path momentarily to try to catch a glimpse, buy they were very good at hiding yet sounding close.

We came back to the house to find dinner nearly done, an invigorating feast of spaghetti. Diss also notified us that Bobo wanted to meet us on the morrow, and we decided to arrange a time in the evening to see him in Nuoro. Our address: the appropriate Imperio Bar.
