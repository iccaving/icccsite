##Awards
ICCC has two yearly awards. Voting takes place at our AGM (March).

###The Herman Herz: _Lucky Escape while Caving_

This award is named for a mohican-wearing old-lag who stopped caving the day his nine lives were used up, having survived some stupendously hazardous situations (both self-inflicted and thus avoidable, and sheer Acts of God).

This is awarded for lucky escapes while caving - a reminder of our underground mortality, and serves as an opportunity at the AGM for everyone to discuss how, where and why things went wrong with the previous year's caving. The caving environment is certainly hazardous, but the sport does not need to be dangerous. An essential part of mitigating the risk is self-awareness and analysis of where things have gone wrong.

###The For Evans' Sake: _Creative Use of a Bodily Fluid_
Named in honour of the two brothers who dragged ICCC kicking &amp; screaming up to its current international exploration glory, while retaining an ever present connection with their bodily needs.

This award is for most creative use of a bodily fluid. The award consists of <strong>'Bob the Turd'</strong>, a large coprolite (fossilised crap) found by Goaty in the Moroccon High-Atlas and dating from the Jurassic era, most likely produced by a Shark.

<h2>2018</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Jennifer Ryder</i></h3>
<p>For showing great initiative as a fresher and leading 3 unwitting experience cavers into a literal river of shit in Manor Farm Swallet. Also for providing the vomit that blocked the sinks at CHECC. 
</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Everyone in the bivi when the lightning happened. </i></h3>
<p>
For getting struck by lightning whilst sheltering in the bivi and for the most part getting away with it.
</p>
<h2>2017</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Tanguy Racine</i></h3>
<p>
Going for the lifetime achievment award, Tanguy has once again distinguished himself on expo by 'finding' many many coprolites.</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Arun Paul </i></h3>
<p>
For his fall in Primadona, and the relative lack of injuries resulting.
</p>
<h2>2016</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Tanguy Racine</i></h3>
<p>
For unearthing a foul plague in an ill-advised excavation of the Bivi and succumbing to it's effects repeatedly whilst underground.</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Bhavik "My Wellies Are My Crumple Zone" Lodhia </i></h3>
<p>
For an uncontrolled fall down a pitch. He credits being unharmed to his wellies dangling off and forming a crumple zone...
</p>
<h2>2015</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>James O'Hanlon</i></h3>
<p>
A dedicated boy determined to put blood, sweat and tears into the pursuit of caving. Unfortunately literally by grating a large portion of his finger into the cheese subsequently served on a freshers trip in Wales.</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Rhys Tyers </i></h3>
<p>
At -850m and after a long trip to Colorado Sump (Duck) Rhys made the error of standing on a rock. The large door sized slab of rock tipped over a ledge, taking Rhys with it. The ground was fortunately only half a metre away and the rock which should have continued its rotation and squished Rhys against the wall stopped perfectly vertically.
</p>
<h2>2014</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Tanguy Racine</i></h3>
<p>
Tanguy Racine for valiant attempts at decorating the SMCC</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Sam Page </i></h3>

<h2>2013</h2>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Chris Keeley</i></h3>
<p>
for vomiting due to exhauastion while on the rope on the way out of Link pot, into his wellies &amp; down the pitch, resulting in 5 cavers prussiking up through vomit. [Nb: That evening we carried 10L of water from Bullpot farm to wash the pitch down!]</p>
<h3>Herman Herz:<i> Clare Tan </i></h3>
<p>
During summer expedition in Slovenia, whilst pushing the deepest part of the caver (nearly 1km below the surface), Clare and Jarv made a breakthrough into a steep climb down a widening rift. Jarv managed to climb down the ~50 degree slope before Clare arrives at the bottom at speed, having slipped down. After exploring the new found sump pool, their one mission is to escape.

<p>For being suspended by the chinstrap of her helmet after getting it wedged while abseiling on a tight pitch in Car Pot, and being choked half to death as JKP prussic'd up the pitch to rescue her.</p>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>The entire Vodna Sled 2010 Expedition</i></h3>
<p>For their Plastic Bag garden in Friendship Gallery, in particular the 'loving cup' of the final compostable excrement binbag. Special mention to DanG for somehow summoning the courage to 'deal with it' and wrestling the many faeces into a daren drum for sealing up and taking up to the surface for disposal.</p>
<p>On being reminded of this entirely repressed memory, DanG remarked:<br>
It wouldn't have been nearly so bad if people had been a little more consistent with their aim. One had to search really rather carefully for safe hand holds.<br>
I have written a Haiku to try and exorcise those memories. (Hmm, should that be Haipoo? Or low poo even ;)</p>
<pre>
    Little plastic bags
    Balance serenely down there.
    Must burn hands off now.

<h2>2010</h2>
<h3>Herman Herz: <i>Grigory Perelman</i></h3>
<p>Grigory Perelman (nom de plume, AKA William French)- for everything from freeclimbing to the bottom of S1 (having passed the pitch rigger on the way down somehow), getting down Swinsto + up the great aven before realising that both leg harness buckles were undone and working rather loose, getting ponytail trapped in descender on Bar &amp; having to cut it all off, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Jana Carga</i></h3>
<p>Jana Carga (again) for her 'goldfish from the fayre' production at underground camp, Slovenia, when using the composting toilet bags.</p>

<h2>2009</h2>

<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Jana Carga</i></h3>
<p>Jana Carga for her mid Gladiator's traverse relieving of bladder pressure, perched above twin 60m pitches on a wedged rock, with one leg through a harness loop for 'safety'.</p>

<h3>Herman Herz: <i>Marc Labuhn</i></h3>
<b>The descender of Doom:</b> 2nd Pitch Large Pot

<p>Finally got past that squeeze... where is that rebelay? What's that Jarv
is shouting?
Six feet below me? No, can't be right... damn, gone too far. Back up,
sorry Jutta,
going to take a bit longer. OK, second attempt. See the ledge now, this is
actually
quite comfortable. Now, where can I clip in these cows tails... there,
that should
hold.</p>

<p>Derig the descender, still hate that part, I know I'm safe, but it feels
so wrong.
Rigging the descender, looks fine, off comes the short cows tail, test the
descender...
yep, it's working. Jarv was saying something about not hanging about, not
sure
what he meant, but if I just unclip the long cows tail, I should be good
to go.</p>

<p>Going, going, hang on, how can the front plate be doing that... oh dear...</p>

<p>

</a>
EXPLETIVE DELETED! EXPLETIVE DELETED!</p>

<p>
Yes, thanks Jarv, good reactions, not sure how much pulling the rope will
help
here, but I know you mean well. Let's see, what can I use to stop
myself from plummeting to the ground. Ah, walls. Yes, if I just use all
that
adrenaline to wedge myself in with every bit of strength I have, I should
be able to
take my weight off the rope enough to... yeah, there we go, that almost
looks safe
now. Oh, good, I'm still alive. Not far to the bottom now, there we are.
</p>

<p><b>Right then, where's the next pitch?</b></p>

<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Sandeep Mavadia</i></h3>
<p>

<img align=right src="/caving/photo_archive/trips/2006-11-10%20-%20yorkshire%20-%20various/IMG_0298--thumb.jpg">
</a>
For his "My Bowels have forsaken me" Marble Steps deposit, which finally explained the great mystery of where all the survival bags + triangular bandages had been going during the year...</p>

<h2>2006</h2>
<h3>Herman Hertz: <i>David Wilson</i></h3>

<p>Working on a promising surface dig with over 20 years of caving experience behind him, there wasn't a person on the mountain more capable of doing this delicate work. Bedrock was visible not-so-far through the drafting boulders. With a sudden trinkle of pebbles, followed by a deeper rumble and shouts from his onlocking cohorts, he jumped nimbly out of the hole as it became plugged by a good 6-foot high boulder. Should dave had been lying down with the crowbar, as he had been just a few short moments before, the story wouldn't have had such a happy ending.</p>
<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Richard Venn</i></h3>
<p>Claiming the award for the second-year running, with an 'event' just two days before the AGM. As much as we mocked Rik was his (detailed below) incident while on expedition, we never thought that our jokes would chime so true. About 60m down, on a Sunday trip, Rik felt the all-too-familiar subtarranean rumble from his bowels. Rigging, he abseiled as fast as possible &amp; stripped while balancing on a small ledge over an 80m pitch. His survival bag forgotten, his brand spanking new pair of yellow marigolds (given to him on Friday from a 'liberated' stockpile) were the unfortunate receptacle for his unscheduled production.<br>
Shitting in a cave on a Sunday trip was his swan-song as the last time he'd go on a trip as a student after four years with ICCC.</p>

<h2>2005</h2>
<h3>Herman Hertz: <i>Sandeep Mavadia</i></h3>
<p>Though merely a fresher, Sandeep had managed to accrue a truly flabergasting collection of by-the-skin-of-his-teeth escapes. From a hypothermic rescue-calling at New Year, to completing (without incidence) nearly the whole of a 10hr SRT trip through Sasenage in the French Alps with his harness unbuckled!</p>

<h3>For Evans' Sake: <i>Richard Venn</i></h3>

<p>Rik is a special boy, while on a short (bounce) trip in Slovenia, he suddenly found himself caught out by movement within his bowels. His survival bag was utilised in its most common ICCC fashion, as a shit bag, but he was then left hanging bare in a freezing cave with nowt but sharp rocks to use as toilet paper. His ever-suffering cave buddy, Andy Jurd, was quick to the rescue with the production of a plastic wrapper from the Malt-Loaf they had eaten just a short time before. The quality of the polish was not brilliant, and after a arduous prussic out of the cave, Rik's Furry required a good wash in Dettol.</p>
