<i>"... the three University Club's histories are very closely inter-related and now the journal should ensure that this pattern of beneficial co-operation will continue. It is hoped that it will even stimulate some people to do some caving with a purpose - certainly far more rewarding than the old tourist trips. A mere write up of the log book has very limited interest, while an entirely scientific publication is beyond the scope of the clubs, so this journal is attempting to strike a happy medium."</i> <b>Tony Waltham, LUCC 1 Editorial, December 1966</b></p>
<p>Alas, we are the sole surviving member of the LUCC collective. We are intending to have a (complete as possible - we believe there were 14 in the series, Dec '66 - June '73) set of LUCC journals freely downloadable here as PDFs, in testament to the achievements of the now defunct clubs and as a record of original exploration both within the country and abroad. If you have LUCC \#1,2,3 or 11 we would be most interested in talking to you, as they haven't been spotted in the wild since 2000!</p>
<p>A summary of the contents of the LUCC journals can be garnered from the first half of our <a href="http://www.union.ic.ac.uk/caving/lib/25yr_history.pdf">25 Yr History of the Club (1987) [12mb PDF]</a> (<a href="/caving/wiki/index.php?n=Main.TheFirst25Years">Type up in progress on Wiki...</a>).</p>


<h2 class="content-header-left">Scanning once more...</h2>
<h2 class="content-header-right">March 2012</h2>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
We are endeavouring to get all the journals located and scanned in time for our summer 50th Birthday as a club.<br>
<br>
Please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1d608SJVF8VuYYQYL6ah5Z6sqzTiwE3yP1EKmIuToaWk">LUCC Google Document</a>, which should be automatically updated as we make progress. We are typing up the contents (&amp; a 'review' of LUCCs 1-8) of each journal as we locate it. We are preparing to scan the journals with a non-destructive method by individually photographing each page.
