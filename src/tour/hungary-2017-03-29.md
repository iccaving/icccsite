Summary: ICCC is always hungry for caving and so we decided to go caving in Hungary. We spent exploring the best caves Hungary has to offer. Nestled in the Bukk Mountains we traversed X km underground through Baradla Barlang, a vast river, descended 300 m on iron ladders deep into XX, and caved with XX caving clubs finest.
