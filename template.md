METADATA:

Title: Title of the trip, i.e Wales III or Yorkshire IV or France

Date: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Location: Location of trip i.e Yorkshire, Wales, or France. This sets the folder the article is sorted into mostly. Put "index" for anouncenement type things.

Summary: The short blurb that will appear on the main page

Type: Usually either 'trip' or 'tour' depending on the trip report type. stickyindex for the main calender item on the index page or index for announcements. 'unlisted' if you want the article to get published but not appear on the index, sidebar or archive page (accessible by direct link only essentially).

Photoarchive: Delete for no photo archive, leave blank for autogenerated location (will not work for NZ subsite), or type a custom path for the archive (../photo_archive/newzealand/YYYY-MM-DD%20-%20Placename). You will have to make this folder and populate it yourself.

Mainimg: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display in the article, leave blank for no image.

Thumbl: filename including extension of image in photoarchive folder to display as the left thumbnail on the main index page

Thumbr: same but the right thumbnail

Authors: The authors of the article, seperated by commas e.g. "Stores Gnomes, Stores Mice"

Cavepeeps: A list of the trips that happened. Normal trips and through trips supported. Format as below:
DATE=YYYY-MM-DD; CAVE=Cave 1; PEOPLE=Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4;
DATE=YYYY-MM-DD; CAVE=Cave 2 > Cave 3; PEOPLE=Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4;
Each entry should be on a new line and lines after the first 1 should be indented by more than 4 spaces (essetially match up the start of the entries).

Oldurl: If this is an old trip report being converted copy the caving url from /rcc/ e.g /rcc/caving/place/YYYY-MM-DD-place.php and write it here.

Status: Set this to "draft" if you don't want it to appear on the site yet or delete entirely if you do

OTHER STUFF:

To position the mainimg in the page use:
    {{ mainimg }}
This will be replaced by all the lovely html for the image.

To position a list of cavers on the trip, with links to their pages, use:
    {{ allpeople }}
I've been using:
    #####{{ allpeople }}
Which becomes header 5 as there is no styling by default on the list (other than being links).

Also you can easily print lists of people on a specific trip by copying and pasting what you wrote in the cavepeeps metadata! For example:

{{ DATE=2016-01-01; CAVE=Jingling Pot; }}

Again, thats just a list of plain links so format it nicely:

###Cave Name: {{ DATE=2016-01-01; CAVE=Jingling Pot; }}

There is a plugin active to allow easy inline posting of images. Similar to the way links work in standard markdown:

{"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}(filename.jpg)

Within the curly braces on the left there is a caption in quotes, this is optional. There is also an alignment (left) on the right which can be left/right/center. In the round braces on the right is the url in quotes of the image. This will link to photos in the specified photoarchive (i.e just use the filename!). Also the link ('href' attribute of 'a' tag) will (cleverly) point at the curator html page for that photo. To point it somewhere else:

{"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}(filename.jpg, http://some.link/elsewhere)

If you want to link to images outside of the photoarchive then put an exclamation mark after the first curly brace:

{!"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}(www.external.com/image.jpg)

Both the img src and a href will point to the image. If you want the 'a' tag 'href' (image link) to point somewhere else:

{!"Caption Goes Here Or Not" left}(www.external.com/image.jpg, http://some.link/elsewhere)
